Days Inn - Anderson IN
Rating: 1
Text: If there was a -5 star rating, this would be it. BEDBUGS. In the first two rooms we tried. Eggs in the mattress in one too. One of the other people we roomed with found a needle and syringe under the bed. The shower made loud noises when turned on and it’s in a bad part of town. Worst and nastiest hotel I’ve EVER been too. Absolutely disgusting.

Text: One word: BEDBUGS. I'm not sure how this place is still running, but it is disgusting! We reserved a room, and it ended up having bed bugs literally crawling on the sheets! We caught some, and took them to the front desk to see what would be done about it. The guy at the front desk said he'd only been working there for one week, and he can only move us to another room. My spouse, and I were already feeling uneasy from the 1st room, but we gave it a second chance. After a thorough inspection of the second room, we found it to have bedbugs as well! We didn't want to stay there, or sleep there, and wanted our money back to go elsewhere! After a long argument with another employee, she finally told us the owners of the independently owned place know they have bedbugs, and just don't care. She said we can fight them on it, but they've always found a way to get away with it. The owners are rude, and DO NOT treat their guests nicely! So, f**k this hotel! DO NOT STAY HERE! Ask to see the room before you sign ANY paperwork, and thoroughly inspect it for bedbugs! An attorney I spoke with said any pictures/videos you take of bites you've received from the bugs, and even if you can capture some, and put them in a bottle or something! will help with getting the owners in trouble with the State Health Department. Worst damn hotel I've ever experienced.

Text: I’ve stayed in several other Days Inn and this was by far the worst one I’ve been too! Not at all what was advertised online! Rooms and halls smelled of smoke even though it’s a non smoking motel but worse yet the hallway had an overwhelming smell of cat urine not in just one area either! Once inside the room our bathroom still hair from the previous guest and the shower wasn’t cleaned either! Many updates shown to be done online but none were actually done to the rooms our ceiling had a huge hole by the sprinkler and the bathroom light was turned in My a turn dial that buzzed until the time ran out which the light would shut off at that point also the bed sheets were not clean! We did not stay we actually chose to leave and go over to the Best Western Plus for the night! Very unhappy about the whole situation!

Text: This hotel is conveintly located just off I-69. When you walk in, you are pleasantly greeted by staff. No matter what entry you use to go in, you are pleased by the clean grounds, inside appearances, crisp clean aroma. The rooms are neatly arranged, spotless clean, and well equipt with all the amenities a hotel guest needs. Not to mention, no bed bugs or other creepy crawlers inside! Breakfast is provided and has a great selection and taste. Nothing I needed of staff was ever a bother. I will stay at this hotel everytime I come to this area. The price was pleasant as well!!! Hands down, you cannot go wrong staying here!
