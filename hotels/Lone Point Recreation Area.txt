Lone Point Recreation Area
Rating: 4
Text: Lonepoint is my favorite. Love the waterfront sites & how they are spaced apart from one another. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there are not near enough water spiggots. A nice clean quiet campground.

Text: Spacious and quiet sites. Always enjoy a little r&r here. We camp here 4-5 times a year. Lots of great views overlooking the lake.
