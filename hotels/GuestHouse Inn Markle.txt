Text: Not a good place to stay. Very outdated,  and reception needs a bunch of work. Attitude not good at all; in fact,  my wife wanted to find another place to stay.  Beds were ok, but I will not stay there again.

Text: About a month ago I stayed at The Guest House Inn with my sister.  It is a very nice hotel.  We were traveling south and after a couple hours I realized my pillow was not with us.  I called, and a young lady told me they would ship it if they had it, which they did.  I called again, 2 weeks later, and this time Tasha assured me it would ship today as it was behind the front desk.  I was very impressed with how professional Tasha was.  It has been 3 weeks since I talked to Tasha and I still don't have my pillow.  I called again and talked to a man that was hard to understand.  I assume it was the manager as he said it was in his office.  He said he will ship it to me tomorrow. Why haven't they called me or something.  They have had my address and phone number since I talked to Tasha.  Hope it comes soon.

Text: If you want to stay in a tiny room with NO fitted sheets and a tiny bathroom.  It's great.  Price was kind of high for what we got.  Ugly rooms, just plain jane... nothing to write home about.  Not the best place for a night out with your spouse.  Bathroom wasn't squeaky clean, which besides bedding is most important to me.  REALLY hated there was not a fitted sheet on the bed... that is just lazy.  Bedding was clean, just ugly.  Cheapo soap & only shampoo.  Towels were small and very rough.  Not a place I would want to stay in again.
