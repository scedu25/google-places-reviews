Casa On The Bay
Rating: 5
Text: Extremely Impressed with Decision to pick Casa on the Bay for a Weekend Getaway. The Grounds are very well Kept, we stayed in the Log Cabin with the Loft. The Cabin was Clean and Very well Prepped for our Arrival. The Cabin also included a Private in-ground Pool just off a Nice Deck attached to the Cabin. The Surrounding Area was Quiet and Peaceful... To top it off, included was use of the Property's Boat, which is one of the Best ways to Experience Lake Shafer.....IMO. This was the 1st but definitely not the last time we will be visiting Casa on the Bay. Although we stayed in the Log Cabin which was Great the Owner gave my Wife and I a Tour of the other Rental Property which is a 3 Bedroom House. On our next visit I think we will make accommodations to stay there with some Friends. Very Modern Decor, Outside Gas Fire Pit for late night hanging out ?.....Once again, Great stay and Thank you Barb and Caesar for your Hospitality! ?

Text: I had an amazing experience at the cabin. I come here every few years to just get away from the craziness of this world. It's super quiet and really peaceful. At the same time the owners are the nicest people in the world and go out of their way to help every single person staying there. The new jacuzzi, the pool and the boat are pretty amazing! Not sure what else this place could have.

If you are looking to relax in a beautiful cabin or cottage - this is the place to check out! I will be coming back and this time going to try the grill! Love this place!

Text: Horrible. The reservations are ridiculous. They show open dates on the website and then I  call and they say nothing is available.
