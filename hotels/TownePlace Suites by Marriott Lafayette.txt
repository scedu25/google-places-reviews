Text: Located right off I65, conveniently located near many restaurants and shopping centers. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. Complimentary breakfast is decent and slightly different each day. We stayed in a double suite. Both rooms had a full bath with vanity, TV, desk and an alarm clock. Central room had a fold out couch and Ottoman, fire place, TV, table and chairs...and a full size kitchen complete with full fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee pot and all dishes, pots, pans and utensils.

Text: Not sure all rooms have two beds and a couch but ours did. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast was serviceable, nicely presented. Well worth the 10k Marriott points.
