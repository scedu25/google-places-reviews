Text: Magnificent place for children of all ages. Can get a little crowded at times but not bad. We have been twice now and plan to visit often.  The rooms are very clean and they are a nice size. Breakfast is descent,  lunch at the dinning room not so much. Pizza at the snack bar also descent. Game room also fun with several games and an air hockey table. You can definitely get your monies worth of family fun if you try.

Text: Great place to take the family! My kids played so hard and slept great at night! The food was average for complementary, I have had better breakfasts at other hotels. The room was clean and fresh, with enough room for all five of us to sleep comfortably, and it had a clothes line in the shower! That’s an awesome idea!

Text: The rooms are pretty basic and have a strange smell. The breakfast buffet was average at best. However this place is fairly cheap, and the water park is pretty good. There is an adults-only hot tub which is really nice. The only thing that worried me was that the slides seemed to be rested and leaking on the outside. Maybe that's normal, I don't know. My kid had a good time. If I'm looking for something relatively cheap I would probably go back.

Text: This was our first time going here, but we will definitely be going back! The water park is a really nice set up. It offers fun for everyone from small child to adult. The water park was very clean, had plenty of lifeguards on hand, offered life jackets to small children, and had plenty of towels for everyone. There is even an arcade game room with a snack bar right next to the pool if you need a break from the water. They also have a restaurant on site which makes eating very convenient. The restaurant is priced well and the food was good. Definitely worth checking out!

Text: Had a great weekend vacation here. My 3 year old son loved everything about this place. Clean hotel and water park. Good food. Great breakfast buffet. Everything is reasonably priced. Water park could use some fixes and upgrades, but overall great place for the family. Would definitely recommend.
