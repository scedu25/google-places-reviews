Text: It's a no frills, basic, cheap motel. The staff are really nice, but the office is not open passed 10pm and getting things for your room like towels and such can be challenging. There's a lot of tweakers, and no shortage of roaches, but it's pretty quiet and the parking lot is patrolled by cops fairly often at night so it's decently safe all things considered. AC worked like a champ in my room, water was super hot in the shower, tv had basic cable, and the bed was a bed. I needed a cheap place to stay for a couple weeks while I looked for an apartment, and Welcome Inn served my purpose. Not a place you want to brag about staying at, but definitely not the worst place I've ever found myself.

Text: Not happy at all! The deposit that they charge for room keys was never returned and when I called about it they told me it was my loss since I didn't wait to check out when their office was open! also ask if a few articles were left in the room and was inform that it was not their problem that the items were gone.

Text: You get what you pay for lol it's reasonable I guess... been here 3 week and they all of a sudden raised the rent 20$ per room on top of the 210 we pay and 45$ late fee they charge that we pay every other week. No bed bug which is a big plus a/c works bathroom is decent it's a place to sleep so

Text: Very helpful staff. Nicest extended stay America I have ever seen.  Relaxing pool, nice clean rooms with kitchens utensil and everything else you need. The rooms are decorated nicely much better than the other Extended Stay Americas
