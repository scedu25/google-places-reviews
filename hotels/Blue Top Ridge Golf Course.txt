Blue Top Ridge Golf Course
Rating: 3
Text: So we made our first trip to Blue top Ridge Golf Course. What have gotten 5 stars except a couple of things. The fairways were in very good shape, but the greens were horrible. We were at a public course the week before and those greens were a lot better. The thing that upset us the most is that my wife and I were expecting valet parking and club cleaning as I see posted. There was a guy there to pick up our clubs, but had to park our own car and the guy was at least nice enough not to make us walk all the way to the club house. I can't say that for the finish thou. With a wife with MS the course was tough on her and when we dropped our clubs off she had to go the bathroom so we drove the cart to the club house, After using the facilities I asked the guy behind the counter do we leave the Keys in it and he was like ya. It was a long walk back to the car. Sorry to be negative, but was hoping for a little bit more
