Americas Best Value Inn - Morton/Peoria
Rating: 4
Text: Dollar for dollar, this was one of the best experiences I've had at a value hotel. I would definitely consider staying again.
Rating: 4
Text: America's best value staff are really good. The room is worthy for the price we pay. The best thing is they have pool and morning break fast.

Text: Room wasn't clean (Cheetos and weird plastic things all over our carpet, sticky stuff on the counter tops) and our key cards only ever worked for an hour (hassle to have to return to the front desk multiple times a day.) Not the best bargain stay. Has a pool which is nice.

Text: The room was okay.  There were outlets that didn't work.  The water in the shower wasn't hot enough.  The halls needed to be vacuumed really bad. There wasn't much food during breakfast.   The entire hotel needs like a facelift.
