Text: Beautiful historic hotel! Friendly, helpful staff. Lovely courtyard area with fireplace, live entertainment in the bar, great restaurant. The lox and bagels were so good. We were here for a wedding and the venue is lovely and the staff are very experienced so all went well. Would love to come back for a relaxed weekend to explore the town or attend a concert next door at the Honeywell center.

Text: Love this place.  Lots of charm.  They are not always shown on hotel websites.  Check out their website.  Weekend stay was comparable to Holiday Inn Express in price with so much more to offer.  Have their own liquor store on premises.

 Our waitress today,  Emma,  provided perfect customer service. The atmosphere was wonderful and the food tasted great.  5 stars!

Text: Beautiful and comfortable hotel not at all what one might expect to find in the middle of rural Indiana but Wabash is full of pleasant surprises. The hotel has a great vintage feel. The rooms are cozy and plush. Probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in!

Text: It's a nice hotel, but I cannot give it more than a 3 Star.  I didn't have a bad experience but I didn't have a great experience either. I was not greeted when I came in. The sheets on my bed look very used(clean but old and used) the place is old and has a variety of odd smells.  The wine tasting was fun and the two ladies that helped me there were very nice.  It's a nice hotel but not a 4 or 5 star imo.
