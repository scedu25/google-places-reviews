Senate Luxury Suites Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Old apartment building turned into hotel.   Quiet.  Friendly front desk staff.  Quaint rooms.  If in Topeka again, will definitely stay here!

Text: Chose this hotel due to its proximity to an event space. Definitely an older building and staff but it has been renovated. However, it was still showing it's age, creaks, poor noise insulation, loud doors, weak heat/ac, etc. The neighborhood was also surprisingly noisy, lots of sirens. I was able to sleep, but I don't think I would stay there again. I guess it may be an attractive location if you like cool old buildings, but that's about it.

Text: This hotel is looking a little run down at this point. For example, there was a large patch of cracked paint on the inside surface of the door to our room. It needs sanding and repainting. However, the room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the outside porch area. The location was perfect for our needs. So- while it could use some updating, it was clean and comfortable.

Text: Over priced for the quality.  A little run down.  Strange musty smell.  The room was small, but comfortable (with a small adjoining "sitting room" with a frig (justifies calling it a "suite").  The bed foundation was "creaky" and the toilet paper holder kept falling off.  Nice breakfast.  The adjoining neighborhood was a little "suspect".
