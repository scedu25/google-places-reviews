Text: Staff is polite and attentive, no issues or concerns. They explained their rather unique green policy with their lights effectively and I had no issues once I got to my room. I enjoyed their breakfast in the morning and was pleased with the sandwich. It was a delightful experience

Text: The building is a little older, but the interior is modern and up to date. The front desk staff didn't know how to process a day room at first but they figured it out. it has a nice view of the river too on one side.
