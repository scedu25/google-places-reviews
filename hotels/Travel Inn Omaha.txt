Text: You get what you pay for. The room was small, but not unclean (specially for a smoking room). There area looks shady, but I didn't have any issues with noise or vandalism. It's kinda hard to find, but once you get it that first time then you'll be good to go.

Text: We like that it has a refrigerator with a freezer to keep your things cold. And the beds are comfortable and big for two people. And the office staff are friendly.
