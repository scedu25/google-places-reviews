La Bella Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Clean room and recently remodeled with modern furniture and decorations. The bed was very comfortable and the staff was very friendly. They had a lobby with a Keurig coffee machine, pop-tarts, breakfast bars, and water & kids juice in the morning which was nice. It was my first stay in a Motel as opposed to a Hotel and I was impressed. The room was smaller but it had plenty or room for 2 adults and 2 children to sleep and get ready in the morning.

Text: Super clean, affordable place to stay. I wouldn't bring the whole family due to the rooms being small but definitely a great place to stay.

Text: Staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean and updated. Great price! Lack of outlets and extremely loud fan in bathroom were only drawbacks!
