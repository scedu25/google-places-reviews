Altenhofen Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: This past weekend we had a family event in nearby Corning. About 16 of us stayed at the Altenhofen and all of us were pleased. The rooms and common areas are clean and look new, beds comfortable, breakfast is standard motel fare but good. All the staff that we encountered were courteous, efficient and helpful. They lived up to their reputation of being the best accommodations  within 30 miles of Seneca.

Text: Staff was very friendly. Rooms were reasonable and clean. Not luxurious but certainly adequate. Breakfast was good. We enjoyed our stay and if we ever need to stay in Seneca again we'll certainly come back.
