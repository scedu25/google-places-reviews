Text: After checking in we found our room had no AC. Got moved to a second room and the bathtub wouldn't drain. After moving to the third room the kids went for a swim.
The GM of the hotel was a complete dick. Ever met someone who has a complex and takes it out on others? This is the GM. 3 minutes left of swim time this little boy ran to see his mother and the GM yelled at him to the point of crying and kicked him out. His mother approached the GM to discuss what happened and the GM threatened to kick them out of the hotel. A complete disaster and I have no idea how he got the GM of this hotel. Not a kid friendly place if the GM is on duty. The other staff was wonderful. Kudos for having to put up with your GM. I can only image how terrible it is to have him as a supervisor.

Text: The ramada was a lot nicer than I thought it would be. The air conditioning and the shower pressure was on point. The only thing we didn't like was the breakfast area. The ceiling looked nasty and we just didn't feel comfortable enough in there. The location is great though tons of stuff around and a whiskeys attached. Service was awesome they were very helpful and cared about your stay.

Text: We have been here three times.  The building is falling father further into disrepair each time we go. Wallpaper is peeling, and now there are water spots all over the ceiling. 

The lazy river was nice but the hot tub didn't work the last time we went to the pool.  They put a deck over it for lawn chairs because they weren't going to fix it. 

The buffet breakfast is really good.
