Text: This lodge in unreal, on all aspects, whether you like to hunt, fish, or just get away from things, this is the perfect place! Travis and Abby (the owners) really make you feel like part of their family. The hunting grounds are beautiful and amount of birds that are on this land is insane. Travis's hunting dogs are the most athletic dogs I've ever seen, and they really make the hunt that much better. The amount of fish I've caught in their ponds would give me enough food for a year. After a long day of hunting/fishing, the food that is provided is awesome, and don't get me started on the bar...The bar is made from their old barn wood, and is beautifully done. The lodge is perfect for kids as well. They can go kayaking, play pool, or swim in the pond. I love this place and will continue to keep coming back. Travis and Abby make it their top priority to make sure you have the best time that you could possibly have. I definitely recommend checking this place out. When you go once, plan on booking another trip, because you will want to keep coming back!

Text: I have been to the Heritage Lodge 3 times now for the upland bird hunting experience and I can tell you that you will not be disappointed.  The hunts seem to have a never-ending supply of birds with dogs that are trained extremely well. Travis, the owner and guide that I have had each time is knowledgeable, personable and makes you feel like an extended family member. On top it all, the lodge amenities and meals are second to none. Travis and Abby Ewing, and the entire Heritage 1865 crew is a reason that I will continue to go, and spread the word about this lodge.

Text: My family and I had a wonderful time at Heritage 1865 this past weekend! The guide and owner Travis Ewing took my father and father-in-law on a two day hunt,  they both had nothing but wonderful things to say about the young gentleman and his incredible expertise in upland bird hunting. As for myself I do not hunt however the views and land was breadth taking! For me it was a relaxing get away. I was accompanied by the owners wife Abby and chef Tim. Great food and excellent hospitality! My husband and I are booking a full week at this lodge to bring up our entire family for a vacation this summer!
