Text: I give it a five star simply because it serves the purpose it is designed for, location is great, easy access, clean and quiet. Couple who work in the office are friendly and courteous. Campgrounds are completely full at the time of this review. The only thing lacking are trees, grass and picnic tables, trees would be of little use this time of year except as a reminder of the beautiful fall foliage in this part of the US. Would recommend it for Peak Season!!!

Text: This Campground is very close to Amazon fulfillment center where we're going to work. The management has also been very responsive to any request I made.
