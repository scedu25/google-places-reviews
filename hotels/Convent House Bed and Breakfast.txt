Text: A wonderful place in small town Nebraska. We did an historical tour of Table Rock prior which I highly recommend too. There were four of us doing a ladies retreat and thankfully our one friend found this gem. Very nicely decorated and appointed. Marie, who has been the Parish Secretary since 1961, welcomed us and helped figure out a bit of confusion with our arrival. She then gave us an overview and tour of St. Anthony's after we got dinner going while someone cleaned up our room. This is a perfect place to go for a small or large group; Marjorie can prepare large meals and does an amazing breakfast. The kitchen in the house itself is well supplied for you to cook your own meals too. There's a grill and cozy patio area outside.  Obviously we loved the place and plan to come back!
