Text: We had to stay there last night because... well lack of other options. It was horrible. The toilet was gushing out from the bottom and when i went up to talk to the owner about it she just handed me towels. I had to keep going to go get more towels until they finally switched us rooms. Instead of putting the room out of order she straightened things up and rented it out 10 minutes later. Luckily i didn't leave with lice or bed bugs which i searched for. Won't ever stay there again. Paid $121 for a $30 room.

Text: My boyfriend and I were having some problem with our home, so his grandpa got us a room at Forest Motel about 2 weeks ago. It smelled very bad. I had such a bad feeling they had some sort of bugs. Searched for bed bugs, didnt find any. So i figured oh okay maybe im paranoid! WRONG!! I GOT HEADLICE! I didnt think nothing of it because I have dry scalp. The itching became more irratic  and started driving me crazy. The other night i found lice in my hair. I treated it and found bugs on the towel i used and pulled knits out of my hair. This place is trash. Do not go to them.

Text: Very run down. The room smelled like stale cigarette smoke and musty old water. The bed was hard as a rock. Most unsanitary place I've stayed at. Never again.

Text: My family stayed here in October. We ended up having car issues and this was the only place with a vacancy. Our room was absolutely disgusting!! Our room was dirty, dirty, dirty. A room worth 0 dollars my dad paid 130.00 dollars for!!! Ridiculously priced.
