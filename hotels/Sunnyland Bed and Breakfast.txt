Text: The best place to stay in garden city. Owners let us use their washer and dryer free of charge. Breakfast is always tasty and the owners chat to ask about what else you might want or need.

Text: What a lovely setting!  The house is simply stunning and decorated opulently.  Our hosts were gracious and accommodating in offering us a different room than the one we had originally selected to give us more privacy.  The bedroom was roomy and comfortable.  The breakfast was outstanding and we enjoyed chatting with our hosts.  I would recommend Sunnyland to anyone!
