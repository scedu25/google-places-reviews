Text: Bed bugs!! The guy tool forever to check us in. We got to our rooms and they smelled musty and the light switch didn't work. Took the head board off the wall like we do in every hotel we stay in and there were bed bugs. Grabbed our stuff and went to the front desk to tell him we were not comfortable staying there and after about another hour waiting in line we finally got the credit and went back to just double check the rooms for any of our belongings and the bugs were gone!!! We left. We went and stayed and the comfort inn and suites much nicer hotel and no bed bugs but cost a little more. We were more than willing to pay the extra for a bed bug free room!

Text: Not too bad. Price was right. Advertised heated indoor pool. Pool was indoor but not heated. Bed was too hard for me might not be for you. Room was not very clean, someones sox were under the table. Great free breakfast and coffee was good.

Text: Super clean and the staff was kind. Had a booking issue (booked on another online site) the staff walked me through solving it, including what number to call and guided me through the call. My kids loved the pool and breakfast.
