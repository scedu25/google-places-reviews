Majestic Vacation Homes The Liberty Lodge

Text: Had a great time at Liberty Lodge. The pictures on the website do not do this place justice. The house is so much bigger and larger and really laid out with plenty of room. They have great amenities, and everything you need for a great stay. Chris was great to work with, and easy to get of hold of and had the lines of communication always open if I had any questions/concerns. Will definitely recommend Liberty Lodge to family and friends.

Text: Had a bachelor party weekend here.  Pool, hot tub, game room in the garage, lawn for games, bar and poker room, plenty of bunking, tree house for kids, has everything you would want to do at the lodge.  Which is great because there isn't much to do in the surrounding area

Text: My family had our first family reunion at Liberty Lodge. We spent two wonderful days there. I want to thank Chris Dement for making our stay so perfect. There were too many amenities to mention, and the lodge was so spacious and beautifully put together. We will definitely be returning. Thank you from the Parsons/Baranowski family!

Text: My family spent Christmas at The Liberty Lodge (3 days). It was a great facility. The lodge is extremley spacious and comfortable. The property is very well kept and it is equipped with everything that you need for your time there. Outside of food and our own positive attitudes, we really needed nothing else. The owner, Chris, even went out of his way to make sure that we had a Christmas tree to complete our holiday experience. Having so many family members under one roof, sharing meals, laughs and making memories was priceless for my family. From making s'mores on the campfire to wading in the hot tub at night, our time was well spent and there was never a dull moment, unless we were sleeping. And even then, our dreams were full of recapping the days events and anticipation of the next day. Again, we loved The Liberty Lodge, would highly recommend it and look forward to a future visit.
