Text: very cold room! went in October and there was no heat.  The 7 course breakfast was more vegan than breakfast.  Brussel sprouts and squash for breakfast? what happened to eggs, bacon, and pancakes for breakfast.

Text: Incredible experience! While on a day trip we decided to stop for the night since it was late.  We were totally unprepared, but they had everything we needed, robes in the closet, shampoo, soap, lotion, hair dryer, etc.. AND it was late at night!  What a lovely gem!  Clean rooms, gracious host/hostess and an AMAZING, although non-traditional, breakfast that will tantalize your taste buds and leave you lingering to try to eat just one more bite... one more taste...!   DEFINITELY would stay there again! In fact, we are planning for our next trip out that way!
