Providence Inn
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I stayed at the Providence Inn from July 31 to August 5, 2014.  We normally stay in hotels, but all the good hotels in the area were booked solid.  The next time we travel to the area, the Providence Inn will be our first choice.  Kristy and Duane are gracious hosts, the home is a magnificent Victorian restoration, and Kristy's breakfasts are exquisite.

If you travel to the area around Dennison, make plans to stay there.

Text: Was in town on Business. My company put me up at the Providence. Great place to stay. If you are to be staying in Denison then I would highly recommend this B&B as a refreshing change from a Hotel.
