Text: Come here about once a week for business. Pretty nice for the price. Nice staff usually. Breakfast is lacking. Needs bagels or something more. Really can't complain other than that.

Text: Room not that clean. The mattresses have been definitely used. The towels were dingy and the customer service was lacking. Not recommended at all.

Text: I'm only giving 1 star because you can't rate without at least 1. We booked a room in the morning hours, didn't show up until 9:30pm, the ac was off. It was 92° outside and over 95° in the room! The room looked NOTHING like what the website depicted. There are several burn holes in the sheets/blankets. And the shower matt was dirty. I would not recommend this place. You can have a look for your self, I've uploaded pictures.
