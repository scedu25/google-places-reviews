Pinecrest Campground & Cabins
Rating: 5
Text: We camped out at Pinecrest to watch the eclipse this past weekend. Ethan and Marie are absolutely amazing, they treat you like family. I normally try to avoid campgrounds because they're filled with drunken idiots. You won't find that here, they run a topnotch campground, the only noise you will hear are the horses and nature when you're trying to sleep.

We camped near the horses, but for the primitive camping they are setting up sites away from the horses for those who do not care to be around them. If you're looking for a place to camp out, I highly recommend Pinecrest campgrounds.

Close to jadwin canoe (5mi)
horse friendly; my kids were excited to see horses.
They also have a big pavilion space for large events that is new.
Nice dark skies for stargazing, and great price.

Text: Owner was there with his son when I showed up to check in. Extremely courteous and helpful. Campgrounds are clean with ample room. Sites are not bunched up right next to each other like at other campgrounds.

Text: I cannot thank Ethan and his family enough for their hospitality this week. This is my third visit to Pinecrest, and every time we visit, Ethan outdoes himself. The campground is clean and well maintained, and the cabin is an incredibly value for those that are less keen on "camping," or for those times of year when a tent is a bit chilly. For those that are avid horseback riders, you have excellent access to all of the local trails.
