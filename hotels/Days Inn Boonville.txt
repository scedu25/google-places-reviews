Text: The staff was friendly, but not very hard workers. We arrived one hour after breakfast started and everything was gone. Cereal but no milk, waffle maker but no batter, the oatmeal that was made was gone, usually these places put out bagels or pastries of some sort, nope just bread. We had to go to McDonald's for breakfast. The room key didn't work and the clerk made it seem like a hassle to redo the keys. We work 3rd shift so we sleep during the day and usually get bothered by housekeeping if we don't hang a "don't disturb" sign. There wasn't one in the room and I had to ask the clerk for one, and she took forever to finally find one. The room was alright, but the bathroom was super toilet. We couldn't open the door all the way cause it hit the toilet.

Text: We had a good experience with the night manager. The owner at that time was nice one minute and angry the next.
They are under a new owner now.

Text: The rooms were clean a great place to stay. I would like to see a better breakfast. They should add link sausage & boiled eggs &scrambled eggs to the breakfast menu.

Text: Decent sized room. Rather Spartan accomodations. Usual frig and microwave. Seemed clean enough. Breakfast was very pathetic but there's a mc Donald's next door. We'd use it again.
