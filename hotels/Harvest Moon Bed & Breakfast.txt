Text: We were recently in town for a family wedding shower.  Ruthie was a wonderful hostess.  This was my first stay at a bed and breakfast and Harvest Moon has definitely set the bar high.  The food, conversation, atmosphere and ability to feel at home was top rate.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again

Text: Beautiful and super clean. Small and quiet, with a tasty breakfast. We stayed in the Majestic Rose room, with a big,  comfy bed, and a jetted tub in a huge private bathroom. Great mix of old and new. I definitely recommend this B and B.
