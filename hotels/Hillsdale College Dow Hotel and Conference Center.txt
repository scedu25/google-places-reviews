Text: Very nice... completely remodeled from when I stayed in the spring!  The snacks and water we're appreciated after the four + hour drive.  Very gracious and helpful young lady at the front desk.

Text: This place is exceptional. The design is thoughtful, functional, and beautiful. The decor is fantastic and luxurious, while remaining functional. Conference A/V and entertaining facilities are top notch. The space can comfortably fit 500+ yet can be configured for smaller groups. Simply, fabulous. Easily rivals and probably bests similar facilities at universities in Minneapolis/st. Paul

Text: I went to the Presidents Ball here and it was really well put together. The lights, food and music were all amazing. The only thing that could've made it better was if alcohol was served there.
