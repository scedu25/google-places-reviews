Motel 6 Columbus West
Rating: 4
Text: It was MUCH better than when I stayed 2 years ago.  Love the new decor with no nasty carpeting.  I always pick Motel 6 because I have never had a problem bringing my dog with me, which I greatly appreciate.  On this visit there were stains and black hairs (human, dog would not bother me) on the sheets, so very glad I brought my own bedding, which I always do.  Had to turn A/C off and on to get it to work.

Text: Very clean and tidy. Dog friendly with rooms that have vinyl flooring, and pets stay free. Easy access off the highway and close to (walking distance) a variety of restaurants including Cracker Barrel and Olive Garden, and easy access to gas stations. Very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent prices. This our third stay here in the past six months and we will stay here again.

Text: Honestly nothing at all to complain about. This rating is for Motel 6, not for all hotels in general. All the Motel 6's I've stayed at in the past couple years seem to be newly renovated. The room and bathroom were clean. The bed wasn't bad at all (though I prefer firm). It's in the same complex of other budget to midrange hotels near the highway. I'd stay again. Only downside is some of the people who stay at Motel 6. A few shady characters here and there

Text: We were there on a weekend getaway.  Check in was fast and or room was clean and spacious.  We liked the hardwood floors but noise from room above did filter down.  We had a great stay.

Text: The location was at Motel 6 at Columbus West off I-70. The hotel and room were higher than I expected. The hotel room was clean and well maintained with hardwood floors. I had a king bed. The room had minimal furniture which I was fine with. I really liked that both sides of the bed had electrical outlets at waist height, so no digging behind the bedside table to plug in a phone or laptop charger.
