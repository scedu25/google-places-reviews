Comfort Inn & Suites Kansas City Downtown
Rating: 4
Text: Clean and affordable, this hotel is conveniently located on the edge of town allowing access to downtown and 35. The room was fairly new. The pool area was small and needed repair. The staff was helpful. This place is usually full.

Text: Rooms looked at least like they had tried to update them some. The bathroom was very clean, even heard a housekeeper scrubbing the shower fervently while on our way to check out. Nice convenient location to downtown where if you don't mind walking it is great for staying overnight after a concert or event at the Sprint center. Service was okay. Ended up getting a compliment upgrade on our room because there were no cleaned rooms available when we had checked in at 2 pm. Nice place for a more affordable price if you just need it for a night or two. Beds weren't bad and had multiple types of pillows on the bed to choose from.

Text: Friendly staff.... Close enough to the events, and the Power & Light District that you can walk to, and not get lost. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Will definitely stay here again in the future.

Text: Best value in the area.  The room was adequate.  Pool was small but perfect for my three kids between ages 2 and 8.  Good standard hot breakfast.  Parking is free.  Location has good highway access which makes most sightseeing destinations a relatively short drive.
