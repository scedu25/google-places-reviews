Text: The owner is a complete moron, same with the manager. I had rooms blocked for my wedding but they completely eliminated the rooms that we had blocked.  I would completely suggest that you stay away from this location. They are also completely argent people at this location.

Text: I rarely write reviews for anything, but I feel like people need to be aware. I booked a block of rooms for my wedding. When I went in to confirm the cut off date for my wedding guests to book I began talking with the owner who was of a different nationality and did not speak english very well so he got his daughter to communicate. I was told that my guests had rooms until the day after my wedding. I knew this was incorrect as there is a cut off time frame to reserve the rooms so I contacted the manager. The manager did work with me a little on the cut off date, but wasn't extremely helpful. I was informed that I would need to reserve all the rooms with my credit card before a certain deadline to help with the cut off date. I ended up going into this facility to give my credit card information and was told by the owner I didn't need to give this information and that the rooms would remain available. After the date that I was told to have my credit card information to them they dropped my rooms (even though the owner told me I did not need to provide that information) and there are no rooms for my wedding guests to use. I do not recommend this hotel.

Text: Decent place, felt pretty safe. The room was clean and breakfast was sufficient. The plumbing leaves a little to be desired, but it worked.

Text: The building is due for a renovation, stained carpets and very outdated furniture. Decent price and just a quick stay so won't complain too much.

Text: Good place to stay. Owner and workers were very nice and King size bed was amazingly comfortable. Prices were fair and the place was very clean.
