Text: Nice little town, we were just there for the night, so I'm not really sure what there is to do. The hotel is very nice for a super 8, nice staff. Walls are a little things, can hear people walking around on the next floor up. Clean. They have breakfast available.

Text: The room was nice , the only thing that need improved is if they extra pillows when a guest goes to the front desk and ask for them, I talked to the front desk and he said the person that filled in on a shift isn't his didn't know but I thought ok, he works a different shift he should still know.
