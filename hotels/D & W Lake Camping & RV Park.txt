D & W Lake Camping & RV Park
Rating: 5
Text: My family and I spent the long weekend here camping so that we could visit the University of IL.  We came in late, after dark, and the owner came out of his home to check us in and guide us to our site.  He was very personable and helpful.  The campground is really nice and well maintained.  Smokey the Cat was friendly too.  Would definitely come back.

Text: Matt the owner (third generation) was AMAZING! He even helps you park your rig. He’s got excellent customer service and even drove me down to the mailbox to mail my letters in the little golf cart. Very helpful with directions to local attractions and stores. Definitely will stay here again if we are in the area and I HIGHLY recommend the campground.  Sites are spaced apart very nice and plenty of room to enjoy your stay.

Text: We camped here overnight in a 40 ft fifth wheel. Full hookups, internet access, dog run (nice sized), fishing lake (no swimming), lots of trees. It is quite close to I-57, yet we did not notice traffic noise. Clean and well cared for. Country feel. Fair priced. We will certainly be back.

Text: This place was very nice.  Matt with the hat, the owner, was super nice. It had a nice lake view..  There wasn't any cable, but we don't use it anyway.  Matt's personality was awesome.  They are roomy sites.
