Marsha's Vineyard Bed & Breakfast

Text: This is the most accomidating B&B ive ever been to!! The place is spick and span, the lovely lady who runs this is warm and helpful.  She provides an amazing breakfast and additional goodies made by local Amish women.  There's a shop a walking distance with an Amish resturant (buffet style) inside.  You will return once you've tasted their fried chicken!! Prepare to see horses and buggies everywhere you go!!
