Text: Very Nice La Quinta in Omaha West. Took a road trip across the country with pets. Their Cat policy is second to none. Was a bit outside the city in a good way. Great value!

Text: The rooms were very dated and there were several stains. It was a comfortable stay for a night. I did enjoy all of the staff there. Very nice and genuine people.

Text: Terrible hotel. They permit smoking in some rooms and placed us right next to it. We all smelled like smoke when we left. The halls reek of cigarette smoke. Hotel needs serious remodeling. We had to unplug the lamp and alarm clock to charge our phones. Breakfast was a joke. They had very little choice. They had waffles, but we're out of syrup. Avoid this place

Text: Staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was clean and roomy. The grounds were clean cut. Motel is pet friendly but the grounds were picked up and there 8were pick up bags available for pet waste.
