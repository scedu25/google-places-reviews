Hyatt Place Chicago/Itasca
Rating: 4
Text: Very sleek in design and clean. They have their kitchen and menu open for late night options along with a "bar"area and seating for meals. 
Their rooms are efficiently designed but the bathrooms are a tight squeeze when you enter and leave. 

Breakfast was satisfying with a variety of items like scrambled eggs, Parmesan potatoes, oatmeal, waffles or french toast, sausages and boxed cereal. 

Their front staff was always friendly and their housekeeping team was prompt and friendly. I would love to come back to this location.

Text: This Hyatt was very accommodating for our family. They were able to place is in two adjoining rooms, which was perfect. Beds were comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was nice (best eggs I've had at a hotel breakfast bar).

Text: My husband and I chose the Hyatt Itasca for our guests to stay the weekend of our wedding (Oct. 8, 2017). While they were busy with a kids' soccer tournament, they were still accommodating and were quick to assist and adjust to fit our needs. The rooms were large and clean, and I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Sufficient fundamentals of a hotel but I expected much better. Front desk receptionist acted distant and didn't cared about the customer, our room a had console to plug laptops, etc. to the TV, however the hotel didn't have any HDMI cables to lend! The hair dryer had hair in it from previous user (absolutely disgusting). Overall the hotel gets the job done but fails to go above and beyond in order to convince me to be a loyal customer.
