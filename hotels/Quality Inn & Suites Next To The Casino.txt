Text: Very disgusted to stay here. Emailed customer service with my complaints. But will say if you think this hotel is "clean" you need to re- evaluate your definition of clean.

Text: We stayed in the honeymoon suite. The room had a living room with ample counter top and cupboard space, a wet sink, good sized refrigerator, a gas fireplace, a bathroom and an additional sink and mirror make up area, and an in room safe. The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly. The restaraunt was nice and the food was very good.

Text: Close to the casino. Literally a 5 minute walk (in a cornfield), but there is a very convenient and friendly shuttle in the evening also. 
The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly. 
The breakfast was good. Not just carbs, but eggs and bacon as well as fruit, muffins and waffles. 
Definitely recommend this place. 
(I had visited 3 hotels in the last week and this one fared very well)

Text: For the value this hotel is definitely worth it especially being right next to the casino.  They have a great breakfast buffet, hotel bar and restaurant on location.

Text: A 5 minute walk through the corn field path to the casino, a great, breakfast included in room rate morning treat, and very clean property make this hotel a no-brainer to stay at - really enjoyed it. We stay here on our way to and from Toronto every time.  Staff is great too!

Thank you!
