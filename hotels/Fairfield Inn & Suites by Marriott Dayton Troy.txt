Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Dayton Troy
Rating: 3
Text: The staff was great.  Very helpful and friendly. The pool was warm, but only 5 ft deep. It is small so that 4 others playing catch with a beach ball took over half of it. Rooms are big and the workspace on the desk is spacious. The mattresses feel like they were replaced the day we arrived, and very firm. Felt like sleeping on the floor. Bigger poll and softer bed and it would be 4 stars.

Text: Came for an over night stay to visit a local college. The town itself was so cute. This hotel was very nice and clean with big rooms. Jessica at the front deck was awesome and super friendly and gave us ideas about the town housing. They have free breakfast that was really good. It was a great over night stay. Will be returning soon.

Text: Pros: Nice rooms, staff is great, pool is small, but nice when you're the only one in there and it doesn't close until midnight. Breakfast was decent. Checkout is noon, which I think is a huge plus.
Cons: There is only 1 ice machine and it's on the bottom floor. There are no vending machines, but the do sell snacks and drinks and stuff in the front lobby.

Text: With 43 students in tow this place was very accommodating. They made 'sack' breakfasts so the kids could eat on the go. The front desk staff was very nice and housekeeping was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were comfortable. I rarely give 5 stars! Will definitely recommend them to others.

Text: Good hotel. It had a great exercise room with treadmills and free weights. Just north of Dayton.
