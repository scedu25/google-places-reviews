Courtyard by Marriott Toledo Rossford/Perrysburg
Rating: 5
Text: We had a thoroughly relaxing night at the Courtyard in Rossford. The staff was very friendly and the room was very clean and large. Apparently, the hotel underwent significant renovation recently. We had sandwiches at the restaurant area off the entrance. Although they were prepared in advance, they were quite good, and our waiter was friendly and helpful. We plan to stay at the Courtyard during our next trip to the area.

Text: This is an excellent hotel. The staff is so accommodating.  I was on a business trip away from my son and they allowed me to store the pumped brestmilk in the employee freezer, so it would stay fresh for him.  The bar/restaurant in the lobby is a great place to relax after a long day.

Text: We were traveling on I80, and the location was very convenient. It appeared as though this particular location has gone significant remodeling. The decor was very much updated and modern. Our room was a two queen bed room and was able to accommodate five.

Text: Newly updated, very clean, has a Bistro where you can get food and drinks served to you. We were only there one night but would highly recommend--good for families, too, with a pool, large TV areas, work area, high top tables in Bistro (Starbucks like) with plugs for computers...all staff were super friendly!

Text: We had a great experience staying at this hotel.
I then forgot my computer and didn't realize it till we were hours on our way. Andy went above and beyond to have it shipped to me.
Thank you !
