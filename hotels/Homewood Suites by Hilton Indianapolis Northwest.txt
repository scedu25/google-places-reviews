Text: Hidden away was the front entrance.  The rooms were beautiful, beds were comfortable, staff was friendly. It is well worth the search to find the main lobby!

Text: Whoever Brandon is that works there ... he's racist and racially profiled my boyfriend. He's a Lyft driver, dropped someone off and then Brandon accused him of not being a Lyft driver, giving some kids drugs and threatened to call the police AFTER he showed him his Lyft app to prove to him that he actually was a driver. If you are a person of color do NOT trust him or even stay at this hotel ! Find the next one. A nice hotel turned to trash because they want to hire racist employees!!
