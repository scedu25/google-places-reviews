Text: The hotel is trash it need to be updated. Cleaned and it seems to be more of a low class place to stay. The guest or residents that stay there look to be of a bad crowd of people. It's no place I would stay or stay with my kids or family.

Text: Very dirty hotel. I was actually just here to catch the Greyhound bus down to Nashville, but even sitting for the few minutes I was there was unpleasant.
