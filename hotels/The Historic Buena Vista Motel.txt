Text: Denna Johnson has recently refurbished a 1930's-style motel to 2010 standards.  Every detail has been addressed!!  

Although there were many activities within a ten-mile radius, I simply enjoyed spending an entire very COLD day in my toasty cottage!! I'd had a hectic (and ethereal week) participating with Nora Roberts at a book-signing at Turn The Page Bookstore in Boonesboro, Maryland.

When I said good-by to Denna, I asked her if she'd put an order in for the wonderful rustling of the huge pine boughs when I plan my next visit.  This alone, was worth the entire experience!!
