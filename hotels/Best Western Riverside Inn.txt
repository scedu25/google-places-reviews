Best Western Riverside Inn

Text: Oh my goodness!  This is the most pleasant motel that we have ever stayed in. Both front desk receptionists, Kayla and Danica, were extremely helpful, cheerful and attentive. They both performed their jobs well, plus went way over and above to accommodate everything we requested. The room was clean and included a nice desk and refrigerator.  We were able to use the printer, copier and microwave in the lobby.  The breakfast was great and the decor very tasteful.

Text: We had a very enjoyable stay at this Best Western. It was a short stay.  Really just a pit stop.  We slept comfortably and had a free warm breakfast the next day.  The staff is the highlight of this hotel. I had left my tablet in the room.  Housekeeping found it and turned it in to the front desk.  They then called me to see how to get it back to me. Since I was too far to return, they FED-EX my tablet to me.  I am appreciative and very grateful for their integrity and honesty! Thank you Best Western Riverside Inn Staff :)

Text: The room was very clean and looked new. The shower was enjoyable. The cherry on top cost that the breakfast was actually acceptable. Best value out for a hotel room I have ever had.
