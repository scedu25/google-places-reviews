Osage Outfitters
Rating: 5
Text: Osage Outfitters is a great place to hunt or just relax. The lodge is spacious for plenty of people but cozy for a good country time. It's definitely off the beaten path and offers the opportunity for rest and relaxation. Mike and Jennifer are excellent hosts and make you feel appreciated and welcome.
