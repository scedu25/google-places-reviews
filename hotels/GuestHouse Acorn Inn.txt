GuestHouse Acorn Inn

Text: I love this little hotel. I have stayed there twice and both times have been very nice. It's clean, the beds are very comfortable, all the rooms are on ground level, and it's quiet despite being rather close to the highway. The breakfast is also very good, with waffles, scrambled eggs that tastes like fresh eggs and not packaged product, good flavored sausage links, along with cereals, fresh fruit, juice and, of course, coffee. The staff are very friendly and helpful.

Text: Very clean and well maintained.  Breakfast was excellent with lots of options.  Excellent price and Friendly staff.    Beautiful grounds was a bonus!    Noticed that they are in the process of replacing carpet,  which is needed.

Text: Have stayed here twice. Very nice, great breakfast and helpful staff. One thing they suggested was call them direct to reserve a room. It would have been cheaper than going through a 2nd party. (Priceline, etc) I would have saved $10 using my AAA card.

Text: Very clean and comfortable stay!! Pride of ownership shows. Wonderful breakfast. Although I didn't get a chance to use the pool it looked very clean and quite inviting. Would definitely stay again ?

Text: There have been many updates since my last visit three years ago. Fortunately, the friendly   and helpful staff are still in place. The room was spacious and clean, beds comfortable and linens sparkled. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with a delightful garden and walk  area. The breakfast served was hearty and delicious served in a delightful sunny eating area. I plan to make Acorn Inn my place to stay when visiting the Missouri Star Quilt Company.
