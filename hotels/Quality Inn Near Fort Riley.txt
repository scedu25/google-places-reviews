Text: Very nice facility. Easy to locate from the interstate. Clean rooms, pleasant and knowledgeable staff. Pool is outside only available until 10:00pm. The only drawback we see is the lack of an elevator.

Text: The super friendly front desk staff managed to get me a last minute room without a reservation by working with multiple people to get a room fixed by maintenance and serviced by housekeeping. Room was immaculate. Would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area again.

Text: The rooms were very comfortable and it was bad for a last minute stay. The breakfast was just ok, they ran out of milk for breakfast. Overall enjoyable stay
