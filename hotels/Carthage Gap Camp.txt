Text: We have stayed at this campground several times and will keep coming back. Wonderful Owners which take great pride to keep the grounds in top notch condition. Very quiet place with plenty of small wildlife to observe. Spacious sites. 2 clean ponds for swimming and fishing. Great free internet that actually works. Very clean bath-house and washer dryer.

Text: It's not really an RV Park for a one-night stay. They did accommodate us and the place is clean. But, there's no dump station, for example, no site map, very little signage. There's no access to trails or the beautiful hills that surround it. It's more for long-term RVers.

Text: As parents of an Ohio University student, we have come to love this campground when visiting the area as it is only minutes away from campus.  The owners are beyond friendly and helpful.  The campground, situated in a secluded country setting, is very clean, well maintained, and accommodates RVs/campers of all sizes.  It's one that makes our permanent "must camp" list!
