Comfort Inn & Suites Lawrence - University Area
Rating: 2
Text: Way over priced older hotel in need of some repairs. Spent one night here and will probably be the last. This hotel is in need of some updates/remodeling repairs. There were patches all over the walls and hallways, rooms had marks and stains on the walls and needed paint. We had the two bed suite that had the pull out sleeper sofa and the mattress was as flat as a pancake and was falling apart to where the stuffing and springs were exposed. Couch cushions were stained same with one of the comforters. Lighting? in our room was very dark and did not feel cozy at all. Pool lighting was horrible as well along with cloudy water. Breakfast in the morning was a nightmare definitely not enough tables and chairs to accommodate everyone and food was okay not much to choose from. Pet fee was only $10 which was nice but we paid close to $200 for one night which is way over priced for an outdated hotel in need of repairs.

Text: Staff was friendly but the room was definitely not worth what we paid.  It was very rundown.  In need of serious paint.  Breakfast area cannot accommodate for the amount of rooms.  It was clean enough to stay the night but again for $200 I expect much better quality.  I have stayed in much nicer rooms for a lot less.

Text: Was spendy but we stayed at cheap hotels that sucked and this place was nice! Clean large room, breakfast was good, sausage, good yogurt, etc. Worth the $103 for two queen beds with large bathroom, plenty of room for the four of us. We'll be back!

Text: This was a very comfortable stay.  It was less expensive than the other well known hotels near it, but was clean, had great beds, and the staff were accommodating.   Recommended!
