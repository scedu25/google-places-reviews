Text: Stayed here as part of a wedding block. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. Very comfortable stay. While we were there it looked like they were renovating the dining/entrance area. We forgot a toothbrush and the main desk provided one for us complimentary. Very nice!

Text: This hotel seemed a little older but was in great shape. The bed was new and very comfy, they had lots of tv channels to choose from, and everything was clean-- including the remote. (They have special easy to clean remotes so I'm assuming they keep up with it). Staff wasn't super friendly when I got there but they got me my room keys so that's what's important. Best part is that Graeter's ice cream shop is in their parking lot!
