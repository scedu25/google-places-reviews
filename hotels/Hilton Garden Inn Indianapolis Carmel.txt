Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis/Carmel
Rating: 5
Text: Great hotel with a great staff. Rooms with 2 queens beds were a little tight, but comfortable. Pool area was really nice too. We also liked the fire pit. Breakfast wasn't free, but the kids are free with our meals. Overall a great place to stay.

Text: The rooms here were clean, and I loved the free coffee bar in the morning. The restaurant food wasn't very good, but that's common for hotels. Overall this was a good stay!

Text: The hotel itself appeared to be a little smaller than most HGI. I especially noticed it in the breakfast/bar section. The surrounding area was nice and I felt safe in Carmel. An apartment complex was across the parking lot but not adjoining it. The air conditioning in our room didn't work as well as we would have liked. The room remained just sort of cool to a little stuffy. Overall our stay was fine and we would stay there again.

Text: Nice location near the highway.   I had a room on the highway side of the building and was able to sleep comfortably.  Be a Hilton Honors member for a free breakfast.   The chef made an excellent omelette to order.  Kids were able to make their own waffles.  Pool is indoors and on the small side.

Text: The rooms were nice for the night I stayed; however, the wifi setup is incredibly limited unless you pay a nightly fee.
