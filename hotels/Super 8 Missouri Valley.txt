Super 8 Missouri Valley

Text: This was a wonderful stay. Cheerful check-in, she gave us an idea we would have missed for our free time.  Nice room.  I would have appreciated kleenex in the room, the shampoo was difficult to open with wet hands, but this is minor.  The breakfast was nice with waffles to make yourself.  We could tell the hotel had been recently renovated.  I enjoyed the artwork in the common areas. The sidewalk outside needed some work, but overall a wonderful stay.

Text: The hotel is tucked back away from busy roads and highways, rooms were small and the beds were not great, but had everything you needed for a quick overnight nap. Super 8s unfortunately have a reputation for attracting late night drunk/party crowds as guests which being combined with their paper thin walls and ceilings makes for a very sleepless night. I was unfortunate enough on this visit to experience that, but the overnight management addressed the issue (with no reported complaints that I'm aware of, they were easily loud enough too be heard all the way to the lobby) and I was back to sleep quickly enough no nothing major there. I generally prefer a little higher quality rooms, but it got the job done for an overnight nap during my trip.

Text: There is no Super8 in town anymore. America's Best Value Inn should do something about updating Maps to show their location is the same location as the Old Super 8, since it has been over a year. Obvious ABVI doesn't care the customers are still looking for Super8 when they stop there.

Text: My room wasn't all that big, but it was just for a night and was clean and tidy. The location was good for getting off and on the interstate.

Text: Surprisingly very comfortable beds! We usually only stay at Hilton Hotels but we swung in here because it was late and we were only going to catch about a 4 hour sleep. It turned out to be 4 hours if great sleep! Would definitely recommend it.
