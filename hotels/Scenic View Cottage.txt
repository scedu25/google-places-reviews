Scenic View Cottage
Rating: 5
Text: I don't think you'll find more gracious hosts than Bob and Betty Hoop anywhere. This one cottage is their only rental unit, so if you're looking for tranquility and quiet in a secluded setting this is the place. There is an extensive forest to explore starting right behind the cottage if you visit when deer are not in season when hunters are out there. Take your GPS tracker to find your way back as this is raw wilderness with no marked trails. Be sure to visit the two Amish Markets nearby. The oak, cherry, and cedar furniture pieces at Miller's are like works of art. What? You didn't know anybody made furniture like this anymore? The Amish still do! If you want to eat out and have some really good home cooked food in a Mom and Pop type atmosphere you'll want to go to the White Star Restaurant in the village of Peebles. Going to Adams County is like going back in the past, maybe the 1950s, and the only thing that looks different are the cars on the road.
