Text: This location was easily accessible from the highway. It has enough nearby places to eat without having to drive very far at all. Well lit parking and the staff was very friendly checking in. Room was good size and the beds were comfy. Fridge and microwaves in the standard rooms were a nice touch. It looks well updated and had plenty of options for breakfast. Eggs, cereal, waffles, fruit etc. Fresh coffee was always available during my stay. They even had a good workout room with more than couple of machines.

Text: Nice, polite, friendly staff. I have stayed in this hotel 5 separate time. Each time I have had 4 children ages 8 and under. Only once have we not been able to get connecting room. Luckily that trip I also had a 17 year old with me.  The breakfast always has waffles, fresh fruit, cereal and some type of egg and meat. My kids love the indoor pool and I enjoy them getting out their energy. The only 'complaint' I have is, it's time for them to clean the carpet in the rooms I stayed in this last trip.

Text: Very clean, comfortable and friendly! Would definitely stay again. I do wonder, though, why the faucet is positioned in the corner of a rectangular sink. Do they have many visitors with tiny hands that form right angles?

Text: Breakfast was fine. Good gym and pool. Doors close loudly,, let too much light in, and disturb sleep.
