The Golf Club at Swan Lake Resort
Rating: 3
Text: During my two day stay at the resort, I had to call the front desk at 2:15 in the morning on Saturday night  because of the wedding party in the rooms 
next door and across the hall were yelling, kicking doors, slamming door, and continuous knocking.  Their rude behavior started about 10:30.  After calling the front desk it took an hour or so for them to quit their rude behavior...that was after 3:30.  They should have been told to leave.  Where was security?! I have never experienced this at any hotel I have ever stayed at. They offered me no discount or an apology from the General Manager!!  The room was very nice and it was clean.  Golf was great!  The helpers at the club were wonderful!  Food is great too!
