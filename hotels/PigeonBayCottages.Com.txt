Text: Beautiful place. I was with a bunch of coworkers and it was perfect for a "team building" activity.  It would be great for one or two families also.

Text: Great location for day tripping to Point Pelee National Park and many beaches within a 15-20min drive. There are also three good golf courses nearby and many good restaurants in Kingsville. Jack Miners Bird Sanctuary and Colosanti's Tropical Gardens are also 10 minutes away. 
The Cottage was restful, rustic and a remarkable haven on the shore of Lake Erie with an awesome view. 
The hosts Darren and Irene are always available and helpful with everything.

Text: Beautiful, serine cottages not to far from home! A place to go relax and take in the beautiful views of the lake and the sounds of the birds. The bonus is that it's pet friendly, and I was able to bring along my two furry friends to enjoy the sounds of the water and relax on the porch with me.

Text: I stayed at Pigeon Bay cottages this summer supporting adults with developmental disabilities. All folks who came up with me had a fabulous time. Darren and Irene were very accommodating to our needs. Very relaxing view of the lake, I look forward to coming back again
