Rating: 5
Text: Excellent service from Betty at the front counter to our server in the lobby restaurant.  Extremely clean and comfortable room.  Unpretentious, kind and happy people, oh!  AND affordable!  Would definitely stay here again.

Text: The staff was friendly, the bed was comfortable. The carpet was horrid. There were huge stains all over it. It looked like a crime scene. I have never seen a Holiday inn that had carpet issues like this. It was just  nasty. This should be fixed immediately. Room 308..
