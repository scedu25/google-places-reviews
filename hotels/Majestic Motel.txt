Majestic Motel

Text: This place is a run down no tell hotel. We had three fisherman in our party and we got 3 hard and uncomfortable beds. The fish cleaning station didn't have a roof or an adequate lighting set up. Literally had to run our own extension cord to light the area up in the rain. My brother booked the rooms and was told there would be ice available for keeping our fish fresh. Ice was nonexistent and manager didn't offer to fix the issue in any manor. The bathroom was so small the sink was as big as a dentists spit sink and the shower well it's for very thin people. Racks in fridge were rusted well you get the picture.....
