Shoemaker's RV Park

Text: Stayed there a couple of times and the staff bends over backwards to help you out with any needs. The campground is right off the highway and easy to find. I stay there during hunting season and all my needs are met. 
50 amp hook up, propane filling station across the street and Loves Truck stop on the other side of the highway. Macon is close by for dining and amenities.

Text: Went to a wedding reception held in one of the halls at Shoemaker's.  The hall was decorated very rustic. The deck was pretty but could use a little maintenance.  Biggest problem was ANTS. the cupcakes were swarmed with them!

Text: When I checked in..... didn't receive the discount I was expecting...... talked to Linn the next day and she fixed it...... and all I wanted was quarter's for laundry...... I give this 5 stars for the customer service..... but, it needs a little Tlc as far as level pads.

Text: Great value, nice clean park.  Some of the sites are a little problematic for levelling, but lots of nice trees.  Perfect for overnighters like us, but has great rec facilities for families staying longer.  Some folks complain about the neighboring cemetery, but you couldn't ask for quieter neighbors!
