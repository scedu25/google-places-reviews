Marriott Kansas City Overland Park
Rating: 4
Text: The location is great for the event though difficult to get to from the airport. The cheapest transportation from the airport I could find was about $45. The room is clean and the staff is friendly though I have not interacted with them much. They had some computer troubles when I arrived but accommodated as best they could. Overall I'm happy with my stay and would stay here again.

Text: I was dropping off supplies for our company's event over the weekend. The staff were very helpful and courteous. I would highly recommend this Marriott whether you are staying here or hosting an event.

Text: I would choose this Marriott over the Sheraton down the street. The property isn't as nice, but the sheets are better and Netflix/YouTube is integrated into the TV (these 2 things Sheraton doesn't have).

The A/C is sometimes tricky, as it doesn't always keep the temperature, and depending on the room, the carpet is a bit outdated. Staff is more down to earth than Sheraton.

Text: Location in nice area, did wish stores and restaurants a little closer for walking, Marrott hotel I thought was very nice looking inside and out. The staff was fantastic, Pat was extremely helpful in showing me a place to eat, every question I asked, I was greeted in very friendly manner. My room was clean, perfect size for me. Will stay here again if ever in the area. Did wish they had shuttle service.

Text: Very nice hotel! Good pricing and very clean! Stayed in a queen bed room and it was very clean. Nothing over the top fancy but nice! The beds were very comfortable, the comfortor and pillows were amazing! The pool and hot tub area were nice as well as the lounge area! Staff was very friendly! Only 2 things keeping this from a 5 star is the Starbucks was already closed (6pm) when we arrived and it seemed like only 1 elevator was being used instead of 2 or 3 they have. This is a big hotel with a lot of people, so walking up stairs wasn't fun but I needed the work out anyway. It really was a great place to stay!
