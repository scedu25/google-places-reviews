William Ann Motel
Rating: 2
Text: While budget friendly, this motel certainly has seen better days. The accommodations are a bit outdated and run down but still acceptable. However, there was substantial mysterious staining on the bed sheets that may indicate they weren't washed/changed recently.

Text: The words dated, but quaint could have been applied to this place, but..... It simply has not been updated since the 1970's the non-smoking rooms were damp with Febreze. The plastic matress covers we're, to say the least, a bit off- putting the hardness of the mattresses mattresses didn't help.

When they charge the same as others in town, they should offer Continental breakfast. It wouldn't have been a big if we'd gone to TJ's and they'd had creamed beef..I'll j'll cook when I get there.
