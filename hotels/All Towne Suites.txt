Text: The place is ok! If you need to do laundry don't even bother trying there! They have only three washing machines and 1 dryer! Sat there for three hours just trying to wash a single load of clothes! Just use the laundromat!

Text: The atmosphere was low but it could have gone either way better and worse I was thankful for the opportunity to have the room that we did regardless of the fact that our toilet leaked the rooms were low satisfactory they could be improved with a good maintenance man the atmosphere was good the placement was a little off the beaten path which made it okay for the price and that was the biggest thing was the price you get what you pay for I guess
