Text: Excellent breakfast at the hotel. The seating area is kind of odd, but comfortable. The pool was nice and clean, hot tub a good temperature. The beds were comfortable and everything else was well kept. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

Text: I have stayed here several times for work trips.  Most times everyone has been very helpful and it has been a pleasant experience.  My most recent trip however was cut short due to another member in my group finding bedbugs in her room.  Due to this, we ended up leaving early, however because we checked out late in the day I was still charged for the second night.  Even though the only reason we checked out was the bedbugs.  When I called to ask about the charge and see if I could get it removed from my company card the staff was not helpful or even that friendly about it.  I understand that we checked out late and they would not be able to rebook our rooms that night, but considering the circumstances and that it was an inconvenience to have to cut our trip short, it would have been nice for them to make an exception.  Needless to say there are several other hotels in the area and I will not be staying here any more.
