Best Western Regency Inn

Text: Fairly quiet. Decent king king-sized bed as far as comfort is concerned. A little dated. Cavernous. Spartan by today's standards. The nightly rate is high for the amenities but that's what keeps it "fairly quiet", so it's a trade-off I guess.
Close to fast food and restaurants and shopping centers.
Edit-3rd nt. here, Fri. TOTAL Chaos. Noise, parties, adolescents running up and down the hall.

Text: Service at the table wasn't great. Waitress didn't check on us. They're was no flavor to the taco meat on the taco salad. I had to ask for salsa even after they asked if I wanted salsa. I was given a tiny amount of dressing for a huge salad. The staff was nice just seemed a bit overwhelmed. Prices are great for the amount of food. My friends enjoyed their food. Just a few improvements could make things great. I'll still return since you can't beat the price of a full meal comparable to Perkins. Half the price!

Text: The rooms are nice, they came with a small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. The access the room is a little bit limited in that there is one small staircase in the back to get upstairs. The breakfast was decent with eggs, oatmeal, biscuits, sausage, waffles, and more.

Text: Clean.  Front desk is not informative.  No elevator.  No hot tub.  Mirror in room fell off the wall while we were there.  Funny smell in the hallways.  
Internet was not working right and when I called down to the front desk for help, they just gave me a 888# for tech support to trouble shoot myself. What a joke....  On the last day, there were roach's in the bathroom.  When I explained everything about my stay I just listed when I was checking out,  the girl at the front desk couldn't have cared less.
