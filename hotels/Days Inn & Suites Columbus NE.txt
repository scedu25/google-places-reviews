Text: Staff were very friendly. Room was very nice with a kitchenette, full size refridgerator, dishwasher and cooktop. Dishes including pots & pans included as well. High ceilings made the room feel spacious. A pleasant experience. The only point against was the active remodelling work detracted from the decor a bit.

Text: Folks it doesnt get any better than this. First time here and the manager must of wanted to impress or he liked me.  Called earlier to make reservation.  Arrived in the time we talked about and was upgraded to a suite for no extra charge!!
The room was great and had dinner at a recommendation of the manager and this was awesome.
Its very nice to know that this hotel manager loves what he does.  This gentleman will never forget the kindness shown.
