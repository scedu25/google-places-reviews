Text: We had a king suite and it was perfect. Quiet, secluded, huge living area. It could use some updates with more outlets next to the bed and more modern furnishings but would definitely stay again.

Text: We were in town for a basketball tourney and stayed one night. The rooms were pretty good, and the beds were comfy. However, we did have an incident that was worrisome. We checked in and then had a coupe more games. When we came back our door was open a little, and we knew we had not left it open. We told the front desk and she said it was probably maintenance and they just hasn't gotten it shut all the way. She said if anything was missing to let her know. We didn't find anything missing, but it was just kinda unnerving. I probably would have found a different hotel had it not been almost midnight.

Text: Rooms were smallish, but very clean and well maintained. All the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Pool was nice and breakfast was decent. For the price you can't do better.

Text: Great staff!! Exceptionally helpful!!  Hotel is older and tired.  Has not been updated or renovated.  Not bad.  Just know what you are getting into with this one.  Sparse breakfast.  Older outdoor pool.

Text: It was an older building, and not rundown at all but, looks like it could use some updating. The staff were very friendly and accomadating.  It's near the airport only a few minutes away. Places to eat nearby and shopping if needed.
