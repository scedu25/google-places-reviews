Schenck Mansion Bed & Breakfast Inn
Rating: 5
Text: My husband I stayed one night here while passing through. We have stayed at many bed and breakfast and have never stayed in such a large room(which was their smallest).  Felt like a king and queen in such a stately place.  The town of Vevay is small, but there are some cute shops, antiques and some good restaurants. There is Madison (a larger town)not too far which is bigger and where we went for dinner.  If you are wanting a more relaxing get away in a beautifully restored bed and breakfast...this is the place. Breakfast was scrumptious as well.

Text: The Schenck Mansion is a gorgeous historical landmark in Vevay, Indiana. The home has been beautifully restored and furnished. The room is well appointed, luxurious, and calming. The copper tub provided an utterly relaxing soak after a long day of exploring the Ohio riverfront. The innkeeper is knowledgeable and attentive without being overwhelming, and she made 5-star Hershey kiss thumbprint cookies to boot. The breakfast is gourmet and customized for diet restrictions. The grounds are lovingly landscaped and include multiple fountains and a stone and ironwork gazebo. This would be a wonderful venue for a wedding, ladies' tea, or celebration. Attention was paid to every detail from robes in the armoir to mosquito repellent on the veranda. My husband and I loved our romantic getaway celebrating our first anniversary here. We already plan on returning in the future for a longer stay.
