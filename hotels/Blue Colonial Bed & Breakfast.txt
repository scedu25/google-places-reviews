Blue Colonial Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had no idea what we had access to in Trenton , NE.  We have lived in Trenton going on seven years.  Last night we experienced a delicious meal at The Blue Colonial B&B.  We were greeted when we arrived and the service was wonderful!  Our table was next to the fireplace which provided a romantic Valentine's evening!  We enjoyed the food so much that we made reservations for another dinner! 
                 Sincerely,
                          Bob and Sandy Madden
