Red Roof Inn Michigan City
Rating: 4
Text: It was pretty good stay,  much better than I expected.  We had to stay in 2 ?motel because we have 2 dogs and a cat.  After I read reviews I didn't expect much but it was clean and when I just walked in the room it smelled like clean laundry,  which very surprised me.  BTW they have washing machine and dryer. Smoke free rooms also big +. Good location!  A lot of restaurants around and Walmart and gas station.  Would recommend

Text: Over priced (especially their weekend rates, they jump up $30 more per night), the room smelled like a damp basement, sheets on the bed were dirty and had stains on them, and the bathroom looked like it hasn't had a good cleaning for a few months. I don't know how they have close to 3 stars, this is a 2 star motel at best.

Text: Bed Bugs! This hotel (Red Roof Inn, Michigan City) is not very clean, but we were willing to overlook that because it was one of only two options priced reasonably around $100. But I woke up with about 10 bed bug bites, and I'm NOT willing to overlook that. I'm not going to just write a bad review, because that isnt enough. You cannot in good faith continue allowing people to stay there and leave with bedbugs. That is unacceptable. Ill be contacting the BBB and every authority agency I can to shut this down. Disgusting.
