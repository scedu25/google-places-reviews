Text: Absolutely beautiful place. Meticulous care of the property. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were elegant. Bed was posh and comfy. Room had a microwave,  coffee pot and small refrigerator. Bathroom was fresh, sparkling clean and modern roomy design. The property has a beautiful large restaurant on site. A cabana bar with nice firepits nearby for  evening conversation. Several people enjoyed sand volleyball. Also, a coffee bar near lobby with light eats and specialty drinks. Property is nicely layed out. We don't golf but the course looked well cared for with  beautiful surrounding. We went for a wedding which was absolutely awesome. Stayed 2 nights. Enjoyed the wedding and the weekend get away. Hopefully,  we will return for a relaxing weekend again soon.

Text: At Old Kinderhook everything is above expectations. The golf course is incredible, the food is exceptional, and the service is supreme. While dining there they were very late on getting us a dish and the manager came out, apologized, and assured us the meal was on the house. Old kinderhook never fails to be exceptional. 5 stars

Text: Old Kinderhook is a beautiful resort and golf course. The Trophy Room is a great place to dine after a long evening ice skating or hitting a few balls on the green.
