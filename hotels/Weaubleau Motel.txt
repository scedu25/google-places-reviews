Text: Well I never made it because of sickness, but I did let them know that I wasn't coming because of sickness, they were rude and told me it was a 7 day cancellation policy, I made reservations 3 days prior, I didn't even ask for my $54 back,just thought that would appreciate me letting them no,my company runs through there 5 night's a week and I needed 5 rooms all week every week for them so I was gona ck.it out and watch some racing,but I found a motel on east that welcome my company with both arms out,

Text: The room smell old & smokey. The carpet is shaggy from the 70s & there were holes in the floor under the carpet. There were ant traps all over the room. The bathroom floor & toilet were very dirty! We killed 6 spiders in the bedroom with 10mins of being there. The ac window unit in the front room stop working. Definitely not worth the money. If you are paying with a credit card be ready to pay the credit card fee bc they will not pay the 2.75%. We originally reserve 3 rooms on Wednesday for Saturday. We called & cancelled 1 room & we were given the run around about not canceling within 7 days when we did not reserve the room within 7 days of needing the room. We were very disappointed with the customer service & rooms.
