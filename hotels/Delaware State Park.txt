Delaware State Park
Rating: 4
Text: We love this lake. It's quieter than some around here. Campsites are nice big and clean. There's a variety of activities to enjoy in the park. boating, fishing, swimming, biking, hiking, and Frisbee golf. There are lots of different picnic areas scattered throughout the park. All have grills some with shelter houses. There's a playground and fishing pond just for the kids. If you are in central Ohio and are looking for a quiet state park, it doesn't get any better than Delaware

Text: Had a great weekend with family and friends.  The park does a great job at making the camp sites safe during trick or treating. We even had a friendly park ranger stop in for a warm cup of coffee!
Always a great times!!

Text: Great campground with a great lake to go boating and swimming in, and there are also many trails to hike/bike and areas to have picnics. My family went there for Christmas in July weekend, and there were all sorts of fun activities for children, teens, and families. People had Christmas decorations up around their campsites, and it was an all-around cute and fun experience.

Text: This is a Beautiful Park and Lake which they keep very manicured and pretty as far as the lawn goes. The restrooms were absolutely filthy, and buildings are run down. We still had a great time here, and the Lake is Gorgeous. They have a decent beach, and a nice playground area for younger children. It is a great place for Yoga, Jogging, Bike Riding, and Meditation. It is also nice for kayaking, Yoga Boarding, Padale Boarding, and those kinds of recreational activities. The Marina is rundown with filthy restrooms which I wouldn't recommend using, but the Park itself is Beautiful Area.
