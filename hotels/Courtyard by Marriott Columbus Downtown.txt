Courtyard by Marriott Columbus Downtown
Rating: 4
Text: Nice hotel. Our room was renovated at some.point in the not too distant past and modern. The room was quite clean. However there were some minor issues like a water stained picture in the bathroom. Nothing that would keep me from staying again. There was an expensive cafe with decent food and breakfast is NOT included. The staff were friendly and helpful. All in all what you would expect from a Courtyard.

Text: The Courtyard Marriott was very comfortable and accommodating while we were waiting for my wife and brother in law to finish their half marathon in downtown Columbus. Their bistro area was nicely furnished and seemed well stocked. The woman working the counter could have been a little more upbeat, but all of the other employees were very friendly. Overall it was a nice experience.

Text: What a fabulous hotel. Rooms with a separate walk up / desk area  make the room feel larger.  Nice breakfast area and many places to congregate and have work or social meeting.  As always terrific staff and wonderful beds! Even though I usually stay in the non-Courtyard hotels (for the concierge lounge) this is one of the overall nicest.

Text: A very nice hotel. Convenient to short north and the arena. 
The only challenge is the past two visits there is delays on Valet services which can delay your trip home.

Text: The hotel was great and the staff were awesome. There are meter parking spaces along the side of the hotel or you can vallet. My only complaint would be the sink area had no counter space in our room - 2 double beds with the raised desk/ work space area. However, the hotel was wonderful. The pool are was nice with a cool view of the surrounding buildings. We would definitely stay here again.
