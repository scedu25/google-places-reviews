Text: Mom and I visited my twin brother and his family in Anamosa.  We stayed at Super Eight. The room was comfortable and breakfast was fine. The staff treated us like family.

Text: Terrible service musty rooms and shoddy repairs done to the place.  My husband almost fell through the toilet because the seat was broken.  The dead bolt wouldn't lock because it was the wrong size, there was a chunk of hair hanging from the bathtub faucet.  The management kept us up until 3 am trying to fix the lock (which they were unable to) and would not give us more than a half hour later check out.  The room stunk and felt musty.  So we slept in a room that would not lock smelled bad and was dirty for a few hours and they refused to give us a discount even.
