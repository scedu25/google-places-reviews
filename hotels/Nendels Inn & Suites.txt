Nendels Inn & Suites

Text: I think the quality of the room compared to the price makes this place an absolute steal. My room was very comfortable and spacious. Immaculately clean. Water pressure in the shower was great, with plenty of hot water. Bed was very comfortable. It also had a mini fridge, microwave, flat screen TV. One of the small details that these owners did not overlook is having lamps on the nightstands that have plugs so you can change your cell phone at night. Little things like that is what makes an average hotel into a fantastic one. Highly recommended!

Text: There is definitely a smell from the cows, especially at night. However, once we got into the room, we couldn't smell it at all. The room was nice, comfortable, and clean. The service was friendly and they have parking for larger vehicles. The breakfast was pretty terrible. All in all, not the best place I've ever been, but it was perfect for the price and for a quick stop.

Text: Room had annoying flys in it and the wifi would constantly go out and then come back on, also very annoying. These two things would never cause me to leave a bad review but in the morning my wife's foot was punctured by rusty tacks sticking up from the seam of the carpet. The transition from carpet to tile by the bathroom had a strip of these sharp nails pointing up...when I showed the manager he was unapologetic and rude...do yourself a favor and stay somewhere safe!
