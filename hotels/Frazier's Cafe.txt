Text: This place has some of the greatest home-cooked food in the region.  I recommend the chicken fried steak - best I've ever had.  Also the onion rings.  Soups are good, too.   Friendly staff.  Never had a bad meal here.  Generous servings, good prices.  Great for lunch out with friends,  and breakfast is scrumptious, too.   

Take a detour when you head south on Highway 50 and stop in, and come hungry.   Plan on taking a nice stroll around town when you're done as the food is very filling.

Text: I have been coming to this place for years and I recommend it to everyone I talk to. They  serve great home cooked meals, whatever it is that you order. Away from home? Stop in and tell Larry and Wanda hi from Val.

Text: Get the H-Bomb sandwhich. Its a whole chicken fried steak that dwarfs the bun, drenched in buffalo, cheese lettuce tomatoe and onion.

Im a big eater and this thing can only be described with two words: obscenely huge. Between it and the portion of fries you can make two meals out of this bad boy.
