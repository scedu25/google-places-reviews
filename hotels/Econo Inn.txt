Text: Bring your own shampoo and don't bring 3 or 4 star expectations.  This is an aged facility and it shows.  It was clean, they had the AC running when I got there and were polite to deal with.

Text: This place is run down, the rooms smell horrible. It's like walking into a 1970s horror movie

Text: I am so repulsed  and absolutely disgusted by this "facility" and literally every aspect of it. Dirty doesn't even begin to describe the room, or the man who runs it. He's disrespectful, nasty, and he has about zero understanding of the term customer service.  The rates are ridiculous,  and the foreigner who runs the place should be paying people  for their company, not taking pictures of people's credit cards and robbing them of their sense of basic human rights and safety while they experience what it feels like to live in a Third World country for an entire night. There is no guests allowed and if he "catches you" with someone over like he's your father and your 12 year old self just got caught talking to an older boy, he calls your cell phone, not the room phone, and threatens to charge you even more  money for the  entire length of the stay  because God forbid  someone stay there with the comfort of another human while they're living a real life horror movie. Don't stay here.
