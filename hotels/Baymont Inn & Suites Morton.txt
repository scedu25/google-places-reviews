Text: This place was pretty good. I stayed overnight for a quick rest stop during a road trip. It was a great and comfortable place to lay my head. The room was clean and bathroom was stocked appropriately. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room and cable TV. The refrigerator was a little loud humming all night but I do not fault the hotel for this. I didn't get to many amenities but when I peeked into the fitness room, it appeared to be very small. If you just need to strength train or run a treadmill this place would work. Breakfast was nice, I was surprised how much was provided with options for cold grab and go or a sit down hot meal option. Lastly, the hotel was right off the highway, which was super convenient for my road trip!

Text: The hallways and room were very clean. We swam in the pool, which was nice also. The location was pretty easy to find, right off of 74.

Text: The room was okay, it wasn't anything super fancy or high class. The night auditor was great. The only big issue is that I think the hotel needs to work on sound proofing the doors to reach room. There were some extremely loud kids in the hall and it just be went right through the walls. The night auditor was great though, she went above and beyond to try to get the other guests to be quiet, it didn't work but that's not her fault. All in all, hotel is an okay place but until they perhaps so some sound proofing, we won't go there again.

Text: Good value. Don't expect to be blown away. For the price, in comparison with other nearby hotels, it's a good deal. Be aware, this is a two-story building with no elevator, so if you have any mobility challenges, make sure to get a first floor room.
