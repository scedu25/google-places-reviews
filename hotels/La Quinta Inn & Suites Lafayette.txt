Text: We booked a pet-friendly room and it was perfectly clean.  The room smelled fresh and didn't smell too much like air freshener or cleaner.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We would definitely recommend them for anyone bringing in their pets.

Text: Wonderful! Got a reservation last minute after a terrible experience at another hotel. Our room was recently renovated with a new color scheme and decor. Bed also seemed new with a thick memory foam mattress. Sheets were crisp and smelled fresh and clean.

Text: Visiting from out of state to show my daughter Purdue.  Paid elevated price due to football game  bookings in the area.   La quinta was one of few with availability. Had to switch rooms due to filth ( human filth) second room poorly maintained as well. Will never be returning.
