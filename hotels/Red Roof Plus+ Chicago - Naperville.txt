Text: The room was nice but the turn down service was not that great and there were a lot of weird nosey guest there. One just walked up and down all night looking in room windows.

Text: Normally, not a fan of Red Roof, but this one is pretty good.  Staff was awesome, room was very clean, and comfortable.  Bed and pillows were great. Bathroom was very small, and needed some maintenance.  Water pressure was not good, but the water was hot.  Overall, for the money, a good value.

Text: Not terribly expensive which explains the lack of some quality among some aspects of the hotel. There is no breakfast or pool and the bathrooms are small and depending on the room there is no fridge. The room doesn't look terribly old but is very basic and doesn't have a lot of extra features. However the beds are comfy and the air conditioning seemed to work well so you basically get what you pay.
