Text: It's a decent room for the price we got it booked at.. but let me tell you I will NEVER stay here again.. the room we had originally booked was just completely filthy and, gross.
So my fiances mom went and talked to the front desk.. so he came in and took pictures, so we got upgraded to a suit.. anyways we got into that room and it was completely gross.... there was hair on the floor by the Jacuzzis, there's was a douche under the sink.. bugs all in the windowsill and we went to bed and woke up to a mouse on our table... this place either needs better workers or better inspectors.. probably both...

Text: Room was clean and the bed was decent. Parking spot was a little difficult to back out of and the driveway location was difficult to get in and out of at 5:00 traffic. Wouldn't recommend for anyone over 6 foot, as I was taller than the shower head by a few inches despite being only 5-7. Neighbors got into a screaming match at 11:00 at night, but that's not ownership's fault. If you're looking for a cheap place to fall asleep as soon as you get there and leave as soon as you get up, this will do the trick.

Text: Do yourself a favor and do not stay here. We booked online, and arrived- our first room smelled so strongly of smoke, even though we had asked for a non-smoking room, we had to ask for a change. The next room was dirty, smelled almost as much, and was otherwise completely sub-par. We asked for a refund to go elsewhere and they refused, because I had moved a bed covering. We offered to pay to have the bed remade, they refused again. It's in a terrible part of town, felt very sketchy and unsafe. Will never do business with this hotel again.

Text: I would never recommend anyone staying at this hotel. I had a displeasing experience staying one night there and didn't want to stay for the second. I told them I wanted to leave early and they refused to give me a refund. When I went to give them the room key another lady was checking out early but she was given her refund. So much for an honest business.

Text: Okay the old saying you get what you pay for well I'm here to say it is true about this hotel. Back in February 2017 I knew I would be going to the Faster Horses Music Festival so knowing that hotels would be upping their prices for that weekend I booked my stay 4 months in advance. The night before I go down there I call and pay for half my room by credit card to get points then I was paying the rest with cash when I got there. However when I got there my hotel stay of $399 went to $919 the assistant manager Candace had charged me twice the $399 original price the room was booked for and then charged me additional $260 2'x the balance she said was owed but it really should have only been $130 when I got down there. Trying to talk to Candace didn't work and knowing all the hotels were booked in the area I paid the $260 she said that was owed. I then went straight to my room and call the place that I had booked my reservations through. Because of the time of night there was nothing to do till the next morning. Happily by 7:30 Saturday morning all the extra charges made by Candace had been reversed and I was only paying my original $399 price for the room. However this is not the end of the story. That first night after I finally calm myself down and I get set up for our stay, I keep finding these little brown beetles everywhere in my room well I thought okay maybe they flew in because we had propped open so when we could bringing our stuff in it without it closing on us. After I cleaned them up they kept showing up. That night I had to use two boxes of Kleenex and shove the Kleenex in the crack of the door and frame. If I hadn't done this, everytime I stepped out of bed I would've felt a crunch underneath my bare feet all night. Then in the morning I find a puddle near the window well I had taken my dog with me and she is very well house-trained.  So when we go to bed she does too because she sleeps under the covers and if she wants down she has to come out near my head, so I know that she did not get out Friday night. I cleaned it up and like I figured it was water because it was under the air conditioner. Now I'm heading down to the front office expecting to see someone new and that I had not dealt with and did not know what was going on with the room. To my surprise it is the main manager Ken. He immediately shows me a receipt proving that all the extra charges had been removed and my original price of $399 was back. And a bonus they even took the charge off that they charge for pets. I then present a plastic bag with a suffocated brown beetle. I explained to him what I had to do to stop them from coming in and the water from the air conditioner. Due to the hotel's policy of them not entering your room if you bring a pet I figured that I was going to have to deal with the beetles all weekend and maybe no air conditioner however when I explain to him that Maggie my is pug put in a kennel cuz she has anxiety issues when we separate. So he fixed both the air conditioner and the door stopping the beetle problem. There were many other problems for others staying there as well some people had unmade beds with no pillows no blankets no sheets on their beds. I am never going to stay there again the hotel needs lots of renovations. However the manager Ken did do a very good job taking care of my problems I don't know if it was because I could still take legal actions against the hotel with what his worker did or did he just wanted to make sure the complaints he was hearing about got taken care of because he actually cared. He worked the whole weekend usually the main manager is off. So does he really care, I hope so at least for any future people that stay they're at his hotel. Even with the problems fixed on my card I still will be watching my credit card statement for a few months  I have a fear that maybe his worker is doing this and stealing money from the hotel. I hope I am wrong but when your gut tells you something it's usually right. I hope Ken watches Candace cause she could be pocketing lots.
