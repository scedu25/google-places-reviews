Rose Hotel Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Loved every minute at the hotel. We stayed here two nights, and loved our time at the Rose. The location is just about perfect, with a gazebo and waterfront right on the river. The breakfasts were amazing, and everyone was so nice. The rooms were great, with tall tall ceilings, and comfy beds. Surprisingly they have good wifi in the rooms as well. We were in the Mammy Rose room. Keep in mind the rooms and building is old, as in two centuries old. The rooms are clean and very nice. Really felt the history of the place and wished I would have had time delve more into that. Located right within the Shawnee National forest, it is that which is likely why you are there. If not, there isn't a lot around the area on either side of the river so if for whatever reason you want more options than nature and quiet then you shouldn't be here. Again, I can only rave on the structure and beautiful lot they have here. A great porch with amazing sunrises, awesome views of the river, right next to a fresh fish eatery, and you just sit back and soak in the history of the place. I have made it a point sense I've returned to tell everyone I know about the place. Go!

Text: This is a bicycle friendly B&B (no issue bringing bicycles in room). While more expensive than the typical Motel6s we've been staying in, staying at the Rose Hotel has a whole different feel - from the historic decor of the rooms to the porch view overlooking the Ohio river. Well worth splurging to try a new experience.

Text: Rose Hotel was so nice and the staff was so helpful! They were able to squeeze me in last minute after a camping trip went wrong and were very accommodating to help me find the cheapest option for my limited budget. View of the river was fantastic and the room was very cozy and well taken care of.

Text: Absolutely outstanding. We may not have arrived at the best time of the year (Gathering of the Juggalos over in Cave-in-Rock), but this place was quiet thanks to Sandy (she runs the place). Breakfast was terrific and extremely filling. The rooms were clean and cozy. The views of the river were terrific. If we could have, we would have stayed a couple more days. I'd recommend this place to anyone.
