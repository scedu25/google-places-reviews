Text: It was a very enjoyable,  comfortable stay.
The beds here are amazingly comfortable (pillow top)I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.
The pillows were decent.
They do extra little things that really make your stay enjoyable.
They even provide cookies (freshly baked) and milk at night!. A worker comes around with a cart, carting fresh milk, and cookies. It was a very pleasant unexpected treat!
Love this hotel!

Text: Excellent facility! The event staff is top-notch. Audio/video company is the best I've ever worked with. It took me 75% less time to set up my switcher, laptops and audio sources than any other facility.

Text: Always love this hotel we go every year for a family reunion. Stayed in room 205, no complaints. Very clean and comfortable. I had purchased a bottle of wine from a store down the street but had forgotten a corkscrew and they were kind enough to track one down and deliver it to my room. We had brunch in the ballroom. Food was fantastic and the service was too. Staff is always very kind and helpful stays on top of things.

Text: Was attending a wedding here. Beautiful ball room. The bar we waited in until the reception was very nice with comfortable seats and good drinks. My only complaint was I had no reception in the bar. All in all though, very nice.
