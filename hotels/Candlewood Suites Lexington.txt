Text: Room was nice and clean.  Needed an extra bed  for our daughter so they gave us a cot,  and only charged us for it part of the week we were there. Managers were always very nice and engaging.  Very accommodating.

Text: Booked a room easily for a concert that was in town, got to town and hotel services refused to refund even a cent of what I paid when I booked it due to the concert being cancelled as I arrived in town from Ohio I may add. They never specified that they didn't refund on anything I saw from them and then further I was lied to by a staff member when they bluffed about talking to their supervisor.

Text: Not the best area (gas station a few blocks away is pretty shady) but property is well kept. Lobby and rooms are spotless, well maintained. Extended stay room was well stocked with a small cooktop, full size fridge, large microwave and even a dishwasher. All were very clean and ready to use. Pool area looked nice although we didn't use it. Bed was very comfortable! Bathroom was clean and a nice size although the water pressure was somewhat lacking. Room was fairly close to the highway but completely noiseless. Staff was friendly and efficient. Close enough to the heart of LEX without paying downtown prices! ($7 uber ride to distillery district, totally worth it!) 100% certain we will stay here again!
