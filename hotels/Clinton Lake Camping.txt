Clinton Lake Camping
Rating: 2
Text: I was looking for a campground close to where my freshman daughter is attending college and came across this campground spent one evening, the owner was very nice came out several times in the evening because of an electrical issue. However upon leaving and with the intention of booking another couple of nights stay with family in the next month, the owners daughter Dawn went off on my wife (drove seperately) yelling slow down while she was driving up to the office to book our next stay. She was not speeding and Dawn started yelling the F#%* word in front of her young daughter and continued following her into the store. Needless to say we will NOT be staying here ever again & will be seeking out another Campground! Totally uncalled for as she announced she's the owners daughter. She should be ashamed harassing guests like that. One stay was more than enough for this family. Sad because the owners seemed pleasant & we were looking forward to bringing family the next 4 years of our daughter's college events.

Text: My parents own the campgrounds.  Very nice place to stay. For the person that said that your kids got a infection from the swimming lake and you called and keep getting hung up on? You are a special type of stupid because my parents dont do that and the swimming pond is well taken care of.

Text: Was very pleased. We wanted somewhere close for a weekend.  We primitive camped, and the owner and other people were so kind to offer us some things for heat since it was supposed to get cold that night.  Very friendly campers as well. LOTS of play grounds for the kids
