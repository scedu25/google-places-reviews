The Vintage Inn

Text: This not a 5 star hotel or a newer hotel. The rooms are clean very cute and affordable. The place is very quiet and the owners are really nice. We got the last room when the roads were closed. Thank you for a nice stay.

Text: Vintage Inn was really nice. Each room has its on theme. I stayed in a hunting room. Clean on the inside and comfortable beds. One room did not have a refrigerator but the others did. Friendly staff.
