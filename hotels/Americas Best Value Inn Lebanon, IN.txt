Text: When we got to our room we noticed the headboard on both beds were different heights, after moving the pillows we discovered one of the headboard was not even attached. I know it's a lower end motel but we had spider webs in every corner,  bugs,  one of the lights did not work,  toilet seat was broken and bathroom door was not attached at the lower hinge. Should still expect rooms to be clean and operating properly.

Text: Awful & dirty! Went for their complimentary breakfast in the morning when it first opened for service & all they had was a half dozen stale mini-bagels, coffee & some curdled milk

Text: You can do SO MUCH BETTER! Do not expect any compassion from the people here. We were in an accident and totaled our car while traveling from North Georgia to Chicago on July 1st. It was around 4:30 AM and the ambulance had to take all SEVEN of us plus all our bags and two car seats to this place. It was the cheapest place and we were not expecting an extra expense. We had to be out by 11 AM, I never slept, and I expected getting a rental car would be easy so I waited till 9AM for places to open, this was on a Saturday. We weren't able to get a rental so after struggling we finally had to call a family member to drive from Chicago to us. I explained the situation to the attendant, I believe he is also the manager, and let him know someone was on their way but it would be at least another two hours. At this time it was around 12, I had already been down to ask for more time and explained the situation as well as got a couple numbers for local taxis. The attendant said that was fine and we had to be out by 12 for rooms to be cleaned. I even offered to pay for the rooms again, two of them since we were so many. So finally 12 came and we had to grab all out stuff, it took all of us minus our 2 year-old and 4 year-old to carry it all down stairs. I finally asked to be let inside since we had two small children and it was very hot outside, close to 90 or more I would say. They let us in but didn't seem too happy and said we had to be out by 2:30 no exceptions. We didn't wait to be kicked out and left a few minutes before then. We ended up walking to a near by gas station and waiting there another hour since it took my cousin over three hours to drive there. No doubt this was a horrible experience altogether but the service here was TERRIBLE and made it all much worse than it should have been. The minute we walked in this place to register, after one of the EMTs had already explained our situation, the young man that was on duty was rude to us. If you need a place to sleep or stay a couple hours this place is fine but don't expect anything else.
