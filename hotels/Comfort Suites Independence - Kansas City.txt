Comfort Suites Independence - Kansas City
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here for a football game at Arrowhead. We stayed two nights. Close to great restaurants and shopping. I absolutely love this hotel and will return!! I loved everything about it. The staff was excellent and breakfast was impressive. It's close enough to the game if you don't mind a little trip on the interstate. Our room was beautiful! We left to go tailgating and when we came back after the game we had new towels and a cleaned up bathroom for the next day. After a day of standing outside and being cold, it was so nice to relax in the warm hot tub before bed. Speaking of the beds, they were so comfy!  I wish the pool was open a bit later for adults but that would be my only suggestion.

Text: Very nice hotel, new and clean. Strong shower pressure and nice high shower head in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the room large. I will say that the pool was pretty small (maybe 200 sq ft) and there were way too many kids screaming in there to make it a decent experience.

Text: Really nice hotel!  A ton of restaurants nearby and a reasonable distance from KC.  The room was very clean and the staff was helpful.  My only complaint would be that I came in from dinner at 11pm and no one was at the front desk, making it feel a little unsafe that anyone could have walked in.

Text: Room and facility was clean. They had complimentary hot water and coffee available for guests. 
The front desk attendant and breakfast person were both very friendly and helpful. 
Good location off I70. We paid $150 which would have been $120 if we had reserved a room earlier in the day. The baseball team was playing that night. Attendant said they usually fill up on those evenings.

Text: They have a small pool and hot tubs. Room was much bigger that what the pictures show. Housekeeping and front desk were very very courteous and polite. The gentleman serving breakfast was such a hard worker and very nice and informative. We stayed this past weekend and the hotel and staff made our busy weekend in Independence, MO very pleasant.
