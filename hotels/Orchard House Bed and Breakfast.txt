Orchard House Bed and Breakfast

Text: This is our third year here and we plan on coming back again and again. Everything has a very personal touch. We were just sitting here enjoying the weather on the patio and Dean brought us some cheese and crackers and wine to enjoy. Breakfast is always delicious.

Text: Charming house, just down the road from town. I did the glamping thing and loved it. The tent was super cute, and the bed was comfortable. Fell asleep to the sound of rain and insects ( There were a few inside the tent, but that's to be expected) and woke up to the sound of birds chirping. The wine and cheese in the evening made me happy, and breakfast was delicious. Would definitely stay again.

Text: My wife and I were guests here for a friend's wedding. Everything was beautifully done! The pine forest clearing made for a memorable ceremony.

Text: Dean and Jodi have made lifelong guests of myself and my fiance. The service, hospitality, and atmosphere of the bed and breakfast were so far above what we expected that words do not do it justice. The only thing I can say, and best way to describe it is to tell you to visit and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
