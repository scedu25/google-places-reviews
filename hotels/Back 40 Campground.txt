Back 40 Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Great family camping spot! The few tent sites in the back are perfect for a group of friends as well. We loved the new owners and the beautiful campground. We visited around halloween and LOVED the effort put into the haunted trail.
Cons-
The gate closes at 10 with no re-entry. 
There is no drinkable water on the property (just hard well water)
The showers had no hot water when we visited

Text: I love this place!!! Movies and entertainment for kids in a safe environment. Quiet time and fishing or bingo and football for the adults. Definitely something for everyone!

Text: SO friendly! It was a different camping experience for us. I would compare it to camping on a golf course. Everything is so neat and tidy. Beautiful landscaping! Too quiet for me though. Could have been the chance of rain, but there weren't many people there.

Text: We just camped there for the first time. We loved it! Beautiful, peaceful, quiet. Nicely landscaped, friendly staff. I would love to have an event in their party room! The only two areas for improvement I have: their camp store is VERY small, and the water tasted funny to me when I brushed my teeth, but my wife didn't have the same experience so maybe it was me. We will definitely be back!
