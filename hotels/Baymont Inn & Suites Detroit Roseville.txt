Baymont Inn & Suites Detroit/Roseville

Text: Good place to stay. Comfortable and clean rooms. The staff is polite and helpful and the price is fair. If you will be staying long term I recommend talking to the site manager and you may save a buck or two with a weekly rate.
If you can, get a room on the side of the hotel that is away from the freeway because the freeway traffic can be heard in the room. It's not terribly loud, but some people my be bothered by it.
The breakfast on the weekdays is yogurt, instant oatmeal (packets you make for yourself), whole fruit, mini muffins and danishes and waffles. On the weekend they have the same and add scrambled eggs (instant), sausages and biscuits and gravy.
It's not bad, but if you want something more there is an Ihop in the adjoining parking lot.

Text: The rooms are not worth the rate. Hotel doesn't pride itself in presentation at all. They are enough to stay overnight in, I wouldnt stay more than one day. The toilet was leaking, everything was dusty, the bathroom looks like no one cares at all. They gave me the key to wrong room twice on different floors, huge inconvenience, I should have left at this point.
