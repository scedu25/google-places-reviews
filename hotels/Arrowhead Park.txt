Text: Horrible experience with the manager. My friends had to come late because of work and assumed they had to pay because of the confusing signs about registering at the front. When they came (45 minutes to get here), the manager told them they couldn't come in if they weren't already registered. She asked if one of us could come up and say we registered for them because we did and then they could come in and he said yes. Our group went up and he didn't let our friends in still AFTER THEY DROVE 45 minutes here after a long day of work and we registered them and brought the slip along that proved it. Also the bathrooms are disgusting and have no light. Not comfortable or safe especially for children
