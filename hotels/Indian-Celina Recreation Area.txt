Text: Probably my favorite campground in Indiana. The staff is consistently friendly and helpful. The camping loops, including the showers/restrooms, are clean and well-maintained. I always look forward to our next visit.

Text: We enjoy being outside around the fire with our kids & dog but unfortunately there is tons of poison ivy everywhere so we couldn't enjoy it. The spaces are really small. The  park ranger was super nice & the bathrooms clean. Short distance to Holiday World as well. We cut this stay short & stayed 2 nights.
