Holiday Inn Express & Suites Chicago-Midway Airport
Rating: 4
Text: I overall enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The rooms are updated. The bedding smelled fresh. My only gripe is that my room had 2 windows, only one of which had a fully blackout curtain. The other window had city light bleed in all night. Currently there are only vending machines that charge $3 for a bottle of water, but I hear the gift shop is coming soon. Honestly only minor inconveniences. Would recommend

Text: The rooms are beautifully renovated with lots of surface area to put luggage; perfect for a larger group of travelers. Continental breakfast is included with yogurt, breads, and cinnamon rolls. Transportation to the city is great; just grab the airport shuttle (which runs 24 hours a day) and then grab the CTA to the city center.
