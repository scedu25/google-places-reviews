Text: Helpful, friendly staff. Rooms are great; clean and updated. Lots of pillows for the beds. The bath towels are big AND soft!

Text: Clean room, friendly staff, balcony is a nice touch in warm weather.  Bar is laughably overpriced and understocked.  Google maps will tell you to turn in after you've passed the entrance. No breakfast included, but those are usually not very good anyway. Bob Evans is just across the parking lot and a better choice for breakfast.

Text: Just happened to be taking a course at a workshop nearby. Hotel is is tucked away nicely but still has great freeway access. Room was clean and the whole staff was very knowledgeable and willing to help! Would recommend!

Text: My 2 queen room was spacious and we'll stocked. Everything was clean. The hotel has a small bistro with coffee, food, beer, and wine. Pool, gym and laundry on site too. Location is okay but great (not many walkable places)
