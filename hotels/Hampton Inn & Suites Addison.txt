Hampton Inn & Suites Addison

Text: Right now the land around it is under construction so it was some what challenging to find the temporary entrance because google maps leads you to a temporary dead end.I requested a digital key for my room and I never received it even when I asked about it at the front desk. I'm glad I asked for a physical key card or else I would not be able to get into my room. The room was nice and it was clean. The only complaint I had was there was a wet spot on the carpet near the mirror by the foot of the bed. When I returned later that evening the wet spot was still there. I did appreciate the check out at noon. I enjoy sleeping in and this hotel let's you do that.

Text: Everything was great. Stayed here as quick stop over as we were passing through. The only thing that prevents me from offering 5 stars was that when we, bleary eyed travelers, arrived in the later part of the evening ready to hit is beds as quickly as possible, I stood at the front desk waiting as the young lady finished a phone call with another customer. Not at problem. She even mouthed an "I'll be right with you" to me, so I happily waited. When she finished that call after several minutes of talking, logic told me, I would be next. She hung up and just as I was about to tell her I was checking in, the phone rings again. Instead of ignoring the call or picking up and asking the person to hold, she proceeds to take that call and again leaves me standing and waiting. I felt rather miffed at that! Life lesson: one person's behaviour can affect a customer's perception of an entire Hotel chain! Don't worry though, I'm sure I'll be able to shake it off eventually. ?

Text: Just checked in this morning; I'm rating 5 stars now, due to there were no rooms available for early check in, but housekeeping was able to prepare two in a very timely manner, and my room is emaculate. I am only able to assume the same for my colleagues room. The location is convenient to restaurants, close to the airport.
