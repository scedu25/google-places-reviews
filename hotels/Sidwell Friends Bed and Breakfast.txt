Text: A beautiful home with a wonderful host! We enjoyed our stay very much--a very comfortable bed in a lovely room with a luxurious and spotless bath. Breakfast was delicious and we look forward to finding a reason to going back to Mt. Vernon so we can go back to Sidwell!

Text: Beautiful place, in a very nice part of town. Very nice room and delicious breakfast.  Larry is the greatest host , and did not allow us to want for anything. I would recommend in a heartbeat, and will probably return.

Text: My husband and I stayed at Mr. Sidwell's lovely Bed and Breakfast after our wedding. We had wonderful time! The house was georgous, so nicely decorated, and very comfortable to be in. The breakfast we had was absolutely fabulous! We agreed it was probably one of the best breakfasts we have had. The best part was the service. Mr. Sidwell was very kind and a pleasure to talk to! We would recommend Sidwell Friends Bed and Breakfast to anyone!
