Text: My daughter and I stayed here the night of October 22nd.  We liked our room really well and the advantage of having a full kitchen for food.  But, I was not real impressed with the friendliness of our hosts.  Sorry to say, I don't even know if the husband introduced himself to me because I can't remember his name.  Her name is Kim and I asked her husband when we arrived if I was going to meet Kim and her husband said she was out.  The next morning, the husband cooked the breakfast and when I asked if I was going to meet Kim, he said no, that she was a night person and would not be coming out.  He was the morning person.  Did not get the warm and fuzzes from him.  Sorry to say, we will not be back.   I expected both of the hosts to greet us at some point during our stay.  Disappointing to say the least.
