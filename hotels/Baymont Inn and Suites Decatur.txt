Baymont Inn and Suites Decatur
Rating: 2
Text: I expected not a from the Baymont Inn. Our sinsk and toilet had rust in them. The bed was uncomfortable and pillow's were flat. The shower when we first turned it on had brown water come out of it and we needed to let the water run until it was clear. The room needed to be arranged better so that the bed was not up against the air conditioner (there was less than 2 feet between the bed and the air conditioner). There were no bugs that I saw and the sheets and towels were clean.

Text: This hotel is definitely a perfect place for an overnight stay. The accommodations were closer to being a 2 star, but the staff and the location were exactly what was needed. The staff was very friendly and took care of me and my pet with no issues. My pet is low maintenance, but he enjoyed playing around in the room and the property is very pet friendly. Additionally, the bed was super comfortable and made for a great nights sleep. All in all, I would recommend, this as a place to stop in a cross country road trip.

Text: Good on a budget, but a bad smell lurks around all the halls. The carpet is badly in need of an update.
