Text: We had a great time during our visit to the Hatfield McCoy trails (Rockhouse).  We stayed at the Baby Bear Lodge in Gilbert.  Very clean, right in town and the owners are good people.  Jeff is very knowledgeable on the entire trail system and gave us some good advice on where to ride. Book your next trips with these folks - you wont regret it!
