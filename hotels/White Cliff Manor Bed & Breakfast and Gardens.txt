White Cliff Manor Bed & Breakfast and Gardens
Rating: 5
Text: Perfect, beautiful place for history lovers. Delicious coffee and breakfasts. Also fun to stroll around gardens, see horses nearby. If we go again I would see if the suite with a big bath and separate sitting area by the old back staircase were available.

Text: We came down to visit the Steve Genevieve area as a quick getaway for our 2nd anniversary and couldn't be more pleased. From the very beginning, Brian was very helpful and passionate about his B&B. Upon arrival he was there waiting for us, and gave us a tour and brief history of the house. He was very easy to talk to and the home and story of the home are stunning. Two of the most helpful and important questions that are almost never reviewed: 1. Are there enough sleeping pillows for two people to be comfortable? (Yes there was more than enough!) And 2. How's the water pressure? (Excellent!) The breakfast was a fantastic quiche, fresh fruit, and a blueberry cobbler. Perfect start to the day. I would be doing you a disservice if I didn't mention that the coffee he serves is top notch also. On the morning we were leaving Brian asked all of the guests to come in to the library for a quick story. I briefly mentioned the passion he has for this home earlier, but when we went into the library for this story, it was taken to a new level. He is a great story teller and we left with some very interesting and historical information regarding the area we were visiting. I would highly recommend staying at White Cliff Manor and I hope we are able to stay again in the future. P.s. forgive any spelling or grammatical errors, as I am writing this via cell phone.

Text: My husband and I had an excellent experience at White Cliff Manor!  The one star review I made with my cell phone as Tammy Smith was made in ERROR...this place is FIVE STAR all the way!  If you like history, hospitality, cleanliness and an OUTSTANDING breakfast...this place is for YOU!  Brian has created a top-notch establishment, we plan to return.

Text: The house sits on top of a hill with a view of the surrounding area for miles, the manor is beautifully maintained, and the breakfast provided will absolutely delight (The owner is a graduate of the Culinary Institute in Austin, TX.). The owner is incredibly learned in the French colonial history of St. Genevieve/St. Mary and personally involved in the ongoing effort to preserve and restore the history of the area. If you are looking for an experience beyond just a hotel room and do not mind the rather steep and winding gravel driveway, I absolutely could not recommend a better place to stay the night in St. Mary/St. Genevieve.

Text: We just had a great weekend at White Cliff Manor.  The house and grounds were beautiful and so very peaceful.  Brian was a great host, making us feel at home in his lovely Inn.  The food was excellent.  It was an overall delightful weekend.  We plan to go again!
