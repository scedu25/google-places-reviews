Bridgewater Inn at the Historic Glenview
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here on our honeymoon 55 years ago.  The hosts are a wonderful young couple who are restoring the building back to the original look.  The atmosphere is awesome.  If you like historic lodging you'll love this.

Text: My daughter, grandson and I spent the weekend in Mt Carroll.  We loved our stay at this Inn.  The owners were very gracious and welcoming.  The historic feel of the building was wonderful!  We recommend this Inn and will hopefully be coming back in the near future.

Text: My wife and I enjoyed a weekend in August by staying in the Glenview. We explored the town and had a great stay. The hotel is clean and quaint, Larry is friendly and the overall atmosphere was great. Definitely a good deviation from the run-of-the-mill hotel.

Text: Hotel Glenview is the hands down best place to stay in historic throw back Mount Carroll. Laura and Larry (the owners) are extremely friendly. The hotel is clean and has great vintage charm. The shops in the lobby are great and can't beat the walking distance to town's shops, restaurants and bars.
