Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham Chicago Schaumburg

Text: Front desk was great, but the restaurant at the hotel (Specifically Lamar, bar manager at the restaurant) was not great. I was on my laptop doing work at the bar, after being delayed for 2 days at O'hare, and Lamar had the nerve to tell me that I can't sit at the bar if I am going to be on my laptop. My request to Lamar is to learn customer service skills and be a better manager so your staff does not lose tips.

Text: Nice room but dated appliances. Breakfast was not the most amazing but was good for a quick bite before heading out of town. Shuttle service dose not run on weekends and is only good for a 5 mile radius of the hotel not to the airport. Over all good hotel and a good location.

Text: Nothing really wrong with the place. Cheaper. Nice location near the mall, restaurants, and a bar. Just a place now for longer business oriented stays with the desk and kitchenette. Not the best for a quick night for two. Staff was also impersonal. Not rude, just lacked a warm greeting.

Text: If you are looking for a value stay then this would be a good option.  The breakfast was okay but the availability of the kitchenette helps fill in its lacking.  The room was nice and clean.  There is no housekeeping on the weekend but items are available at the front desk. Staff is very friendly. My only complaint is the smoke detector was right over the bed in my room and blinked a light all night long.

Text: I enjoyed my last minute stay at the Hawthorn Suites. The room I stayed in was very clean , and the hotel staff was very accommodating to my personal needs with their swift service. The free continental breakfast advertised was surprisingly better than expected. They had eggs, bacon, waffles, sausage, etc, which were very tasty. Overall, I had a great experience
