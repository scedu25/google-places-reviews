Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham Independence
Rating: 3
Text: The inn is great for a quick stay if that's all you are looking for. These inns seem to be perfect for work related stays. That being said, the rooms are small and the inn offers basic amenities. The room had an odor of stale cigar smoke and cleaner, and the TV did not have a clear picture. Wifi was consistent.

Text: Room compact. Ok for the price. Stinky on the 2nd floor, like smoke. And such a simple problem to fix with those wall fragrance dispensers. Maybe the hall carpets need to be cleaned periodically to keep them fresh. Duct tape everywhere on the first floor. Are they really trying? As a female, business, road warrior this hotel lacks any WOW factor for me. I will check out the competition the next time I come to Independence.

Text: Occasionally had issues with with the electronic door locks. But the employees were more than helpful with any of the issues i had during my two week stay. I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the area.

Text: Safety & Security Issues. 
During check-in, I never showed my ID.  When I reached the third floor, my door did not latch shut.  I spoke to the front desk and he did not care or offer a solution.  The exterior door was duct taped open.
I contacted customer support and received no response.  

WIFI worked.

Text: The room was clean and the staff was incredibly friendly and would hold the door open as we were bringing our stuff in and as we were leaving. The breakfast needed a bit to be desired, but the friendliness of the staff was worth it.
