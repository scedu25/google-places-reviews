Text: I had some electrical issues in my room with the microwave oven, when I went to use it, I had to hold the plug in the wall and the TV shut off that was also plugged into that outlet. My room also smelled strongly like Noxema face wash. It was the oddest thing. My room was clean, the bed was really comfortable, and the staff was really nice. I bought some bagged peanuts from the snack bar and noticed 2 bags that were still hanging there that had expired at the end of July. So I gave them to the desk clerk. Breakfast was great!! Would stay here again in the future!!

Text: Great location, close to the hospital for myself. Rooms were comfy. The air didn't seem to cool to the correct temperature but did well enough.
