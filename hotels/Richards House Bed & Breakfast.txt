Richards House Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 4
Text: Excellent B&B Experience.

Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside of this beautiful old home makes you feel like you stepped back in time. My wife and I stayed in the Library room, comfortable bed, private toilet, private sit in tub. Only issue I had was the lack of curtains to cover the widows, only because the early morning light wakes me up. The common area was nice, large selection of movies, space to sit and talk with others.

And like everyone else as said, the breakfast was amazing! We happened to be the only guests one night and she asked us what time we wanted to be served! It was all so good; best home cooked food i've had in a long long time.
