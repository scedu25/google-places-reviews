Text: We rent a meeting room for Bible study on Sunday mornings (CrossWork Ministries).  Very clean, spacious, and at a very affordable price.  Water and coffee provided.  Restrooms are spotless.  Employees are very friendly.

Text: We stayed here for a weekend in work. My entire work crew, myself and my husband, we were absolutely blown away by the amazing customer service we received. Especially Kent the front desk guy. He 100% went above and beyond to help us in every way he could. I heard him mention that he was a little newer to the scene so I just want everyone to know that if you visit this hotel he has def got what it takes and is an awesome man. When we have the event next year we will be booking this hotel again because of him.
