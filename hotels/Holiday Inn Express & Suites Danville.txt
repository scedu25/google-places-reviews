Text: Reserved a room way ahead of time. Came with 2 kids only to find out the rooms heater was broken. Ok, no biggie. Call the front desk, move my stuff into another room. The desk attendant stated there are no more rooms are available... I was shocked that they can sell a room without heat. I was shocked that despite our prereservation they didn't check the room for issues, especially since Temps are dropping into 40s... While sleeping... That is cold... Highly disappointed.... However this is the only CLEAN hotel I've found in Danville. The rest need to check their prices and service.
I will probably have to stay here again due to it being the only decent hotel here.

Revision;
They sent a repairman the following day and was all repaired as well as a $25 discount for the evening for out troubles.
Revised back up to 4 star

Text: Looks to have been renovated around the same time as most other Expresses. Well kept and clean, as you'd expect an Holiday Inn Express to be!
