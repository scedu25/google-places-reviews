Text: Decent, clean, a bit old and worn, but a good price for a good night's sleep and simple complimentary breakfast.

Text: Front desk people were very nice. Room reeked of cigarette smoke. Maid left me a rather rude note saying she couldn't make my bed due to "personal items" left on bed; it was a charging cord. Front desk confirmed this is NOT their policy. Breakfast was so disappointing - the potatoes were cold and dry, as was the frittata.  I usually rave about Country Inn and Suites (especially their service and breakfast), so I'm hoping this location is just an outlier.

Text: Just spent one night on our way through. Lovely, friendly staff. Very convenient to highway and anything else that you need. Breakfast was OK - typical for free hotel breakfast.
