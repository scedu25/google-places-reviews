Text: Everyone here was so friendly and the place was so clean. I wish I had the corporate office number so I could tell them that everyone here deserves a raise. They do a spectacular job of making sure everyone is accommodated and taken care of quickly and professionally. The staff all had warm and inviting personalities and I really can't wait to come back. Keep up the fantastic work guys.

Text: Nice enough.  Doesn't smell bad.  Beds are comfy.  Dog friendly!!  I'd definitely stay here again.  Be advised, however, the train tracks run literally right behind the building.  It's not terrible and they don't blow the horn or anything.  But it is a little loud and pretty noticeable.  Didn't interfere with our sleep, though.

Text: Hot water just didn't get hot enough on the second floor. The hotel was comfortable however it's cleanliness is questionable, I had found a dirty rag on the bathroom floor which made me think it hasn't been cleaned thoroughly as one may like to think. Love the layout of the room however whoever was on the floor above me must have been preparing for a marathon from 6:30 am to 8:25 am (my current time) on a Sunday morning. Walls and ceiling must be paper thin. Would have been nice to sleep in. Room had a musky smoking smell almost mold smell. People must be smoking in the non smoking rooms. A/c was cold and bedding and beds were nice.

Text: Ice maker did not work,no ice machine. Toilet ran constantly. Ice maker in next door room loud. Television had problems with signal quality. Nothing that made the place horrible,but sad state for what seems to be a new place.
