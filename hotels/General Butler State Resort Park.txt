General Butler State Resort Park

Text: Ate at the Two Rivers restaurant at the lodge.  Atmosphere was very welcoming. We had the buffet and it was very good. Lots to choose from.  $14.99 buffet.  Great staff. Saw 6 or 8 deer grazing as we left. Will definitely consider eating here again and look into staying at the lodge.

Text: Always love a trip to Butler. The park is beautiful and has many areas to walk and explore. We enjoyed a nice walk by the lake. The only thing that could be improved at the park is the food. It's edible but not the greatest.

Text: We stayed in our travel trailer while there. Easy spots to back into. Most are flat. Some areas are more in the sun due to ash borer bug killing some trees. But most areas do have shade. Very friendly atmosphere. There are hiking trails and pool. There are also paddle boats you can rent.

Text: Great Place to spend time in the outdoors or grab a bite at the restaurant at the top. I visit the campground with my RV. They have very limited full hookup sites but plenty of accommodating sites with electric and water. The showers need to be updated and the lights need working bulbs the last time I visited in Sep 2017.
