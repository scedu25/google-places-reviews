Text: Good clean solid rooms.  A little worn compared to down the street but a MUCH better value.  We will stop again on our next time through Decatur, IL.

Text: I didn't feel safe at all at this location. The room I was in this very accessible to people in wheelchairs, but people are allowed to smoke and not smoking rooms making it difficult for people to breathe.

Text: The manager has been very accommodating. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast was much to be desired, with a loaf of white bread and a package of English muffins offered.

Text: The owner of this establishment refused us a refund after we had to cancel due to Hurricane Harvey flooding. I do not recommend giving one cent of your money to this business.
