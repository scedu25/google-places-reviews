Tucked Inn Bed & Breakfast

Text: John and Susan are perfect hosts in every way.  On arrival, they made us feel as if we were relatives from way back.  We had a good time visiting with them in the evening, and when we arrived their grandkids were playing in the backyard pool -- and they invited our kids to join them, which they did!

The house is beautiful and spotless.   The town is quiet and peaceful, and we all slept well.  Our boys love the "Quilt" room, with its "tunnel" and "treehouse" (guess where they wanted to sleep!)

We discovered this place last time we passed through the area 2 years ago, and our 9-yr-old still remembered it and requested it again on this trip.
