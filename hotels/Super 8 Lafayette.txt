Text: The dank musty smell of Salvation Army clothing was a bit much at 1 am. After we got the air running, the smell cleared right up. The bedroom ensemble was pulled straight out of scene from 'That 70's Show' carpet and all. Overall the location was great with plenty of restaurant choices in the surrounding area. The place was perfect for a quick 6 hour sleep before getting on the road again. After reading the horror story reviews of the Comfort Inn next door this place was a God send.

Text: Fairly nice hotel. Didn’t like the fact that you couldn’t smoke outside your room had to walk to designated area.

Text: The motel was easy to find and clean, if a bit old. The breakfast choices were few but filling and the Wi-Fi worked well. You get what you paid for, but not more.
