Text: I stay here a lot when I'm visiting for work. Older Holiday inn express but kept up nicely. The staff is amazing. They go out of their way every chance they get. Unfortunately many others have found this hotel. I can't always get last minute rooms. Rooms are big with great bed. Breakfast is always good and they have ice water I can fill my bottle before leaving. Shuttle to ohare as well

Text: Great rooms as always with holiday Inn express. The breakfast was good and the folks at the front desk were great. Wifi was terrible, had to use my own cellular AP.

Text: Marcus P was hospitable and the rest of the crew really helped to make our stay enjoyable. The location sits within a shopping center and next to IHOP.  The 24hr coffee and beverage was convenient on those cold,  windy nights.  Thanks

Text: Clean common area. Our room was comfortable room, but a little dirty at the edges.  The hotel is in a convenient location. The breakfast is above average for a continental breakfast.
