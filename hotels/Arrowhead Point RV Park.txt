Text: This park is in our top five favorites. The owners couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. It is easy access in and out of the park. The sites are a mix of shaded or open for those who use satellites. They are gravel with grass and a picnic table. Ours was plenty long enough for our 37-foot RV, tow-dolly and parking the car. Average width, but angled so you are not on top of your neighbor. Full hook-ups, no issues with any of them. Water pressure was good. WiFi worked well and our Verizon service was good. The park is very well maintained, the laundry room and bathrooms were very clean. There is a clubhouse, and they have a few basic items in the camp store. It is a beautiful setting with a pond where you can fish - release only - or just sit and relax on one of the benches or wooden swings. There is plenty of open space to walk the dog, and large fields behind the camp, that we took ours to run off lead. There are cabins to rent. The camp is right on Highway 54 but you are far enough back that there is no road noise. We stayed from Sept 1 -18, 2016 and paid $26 a night with their stay 7 nights get one free weekly deal.
