Text: Great setting among tall trees and two large ponds. Quiet, we'll kept...wake up to birds chirping, settle in at night listening to frogs. Out in the country, but close to town.
We will definitely be back

Text: Beautiful family campground on two lovely ponds and shaded by towering hickory trees. Clean and well managed. We absolutely enjoyed our stay.
