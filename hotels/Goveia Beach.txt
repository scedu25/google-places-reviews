Text: This county campground looked to be more of a RV park then a place to stay. The lady who checked us in didn't tell us where the showers were and the bathrooms were stinky and not clean. The next day my wife wanted to go use a gas station bathroom. They also wanted to charge us for wireless internet were other places provide it for free.

Text: It was an alright experience. Could have been more tent friendly.

Text: The campground was ok with just electricity.  Their public camp sites are right next to the dumpster, and when we stayed there, the dump station was full/unusable.  I hear Crazy Horse 20 minutes farther north is the place to stay.  I'll be checking that one out next time.
