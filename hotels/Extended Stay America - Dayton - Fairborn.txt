Extended Stay America - Dayton - Fairborn
Rating: 5
Text: I come here 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off for work. The staff is caring and attentive.  Shout out for the manager James and Nathan, housekeeping Marsha and Heather, front desk Katie! They always make sure my room is super clean, that I am happy and that I have everything I need for my kitchen. Rooms are clean and No smoking. I can't say enough good things about how the staff makes me feel welcomed and like family when I'm here. Right across the street from Wright State University. Friendly staff. Awesome rooms with kitchens.

Text: Staff is very nice and helpful. For the price you can't find anything even close to the value you get here. Large rooms, full kitchen, and plenty of room. Highly recommend to anyone that has plans of staying for a while weather it's for wright state or wright Patterson. By far the best deal around here.

Text: Great hotel. I stayed here for a concert at Nutter Center. Easy walk with other hotels and restaurants in walking distance. I would give this place five stars except I witnessed the hotel turning away several customers that we're over booked due to online booking. ALWAYS BOOK WITH HOTEL DIRECTLY.

Text: It's conveniently located to restaurants and stores. It's clean and quiet. This room had a kitchenette which had a microwave, stove, oven, fridge and dish washer. The provided breakfast is seriously lacking with only a few granola bars and small packaged muffins they offer. Housekeeping didn't come daily and supplies were low and only for 1-2 people, even though we checked in with 5.

Text: The suite was pretty decent. Clean and neat. Convenient location, and not bad on the price.
