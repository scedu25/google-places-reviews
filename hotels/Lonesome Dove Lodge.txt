Text: I was very impressed from the minute I walked through the door to check in.  The staff is very friendly and my room was very clean.  The breakfast buffet offered many options and the hot chocolate bar was an added bonus.  I am a little skittish about independent hotels after some bad exeriences I've had in the past.  But because I am familiar with the property from when it was under the previous owner,  I thought it was worth "rolling the dice".  I'm glad I did. I will definitely plan on staying at the Lonesome Dove Lodge during future visits to the Ogallala area.

Text: Very nice, new hotel! Spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, and very friendly staff. Extremely impressed with the breakfast buffet - they even had gluten free bagels, a huge treat for me after eating eggs for the last 10 days of traveling! Highly recommend.

Text: The staff is courteous and friendly. Our room is clean and nicely done. Breakfast was great! They had a wide variety of things to choose from. We have a wheelchair accessible room with a nice wheel in shower. We enjoyed it so much that we're taking a day off to rest and staying another night.

Text: Room and hotel was very clean. Exceptional service, especially for breakfast. We were greeted with a hello when we walked into the kitchen area and she was very friendly. Breakfast was very good with a great selection. Everything was cooked in an oven instead of the microwave. The room was reasonably priced and the bed was very comfortable. We will definitely stay again.
