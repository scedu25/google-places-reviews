Text: Literally no complaints. Our bathroom was private to our room, the breakfast was huge (and delicious), the house was neat, and the B&B is run by a super nice retired couple. Would definitely recommend.

Text: We had a wonderful time while we were there.  We stayed in the Taylor Suite and the pictures certainly do not do the room justice.  The suite was large and roomy with a nice corner fireplace and the bathroom was elaborate (double sink vanity, large jacuzzi, 2 robes, seating area and nice overhead shower).  The home is beautiful.  The breakfast was delicious.  Most importantly, the hosts (Gene and Jacqui) were extremely hospitable. We would highly recommend this bed and breakfast!!
