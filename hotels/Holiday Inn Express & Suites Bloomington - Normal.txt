Rating: 5
Text: I visit Bloomington frequently and always stay at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites Bloomington. The rooms are always clean and comfortable and the staff is welcoming and very helpful. We chose this particular Holiday Inn due to the location as it is close to the colleges, shopping and many restaurants.
