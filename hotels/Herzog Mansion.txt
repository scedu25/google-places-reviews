Text: We were saddened to hear of the past owner's passing, but were happy to see the Hertzog Mansion was puchased by a nice young family. They are nice enough, but I don't think the wife is as genuinely interested as the husband. They just acquired the place in January. It's a charming old home and I hope they come to enjoy hosting guests the way the previous owner used to.

Text: We ended-up having the same Friday off so we decided to take an over-nighter in Hermann.  Hadn't stayed at Birk's previously, but the reviews looked good, and they turned out to be accurate.  The old house is located in a QUIET neighborhood, several blocks from the Stone Hill Winery.  The current owners have operated the place since Oct., 08, and have worked hard to keep it up.  Five bedrooms on the 2nd floor, four more on the 3rd.  Some have private baths, the smaller ones share.  Some baths have showers, some not, so if it's important to have one - ask.  I selected the house because they offer King beds.
It was a hot day but the house was cool.  The AC seemed to be doing a capable job.  We had dinner at the Cottage Gallery and Restaurant and Richard made a full breakfast in the morning.  A sitting room, game room, and full porch provide lots of room to relax.  A refrigerator is available if you need to keep something cool.  I reserved the room on-line, but Richard uses the honor sytem - you don't pay until you sign-in.  Call if you need to cancel.  Over-all it was a great over-nighter stop.
