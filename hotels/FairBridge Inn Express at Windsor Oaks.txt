Text: Excellent motorcycle parking, Fairly large under roof area in front of office window at entrance. Although closed when we arrived, late Sat night, appeared to have Restaurant and bar. Good price quite clean room. Much, much more friendly staff than others we encountered in the area. Will stay there again when going that way..

Text: It's solace I'll never stay in again. They changed rooms on us 3 times in our 2 day stay. Didn't have any breakfast at 8:30am .they said they ran out of food. The grill was closed at night so no supper  or breakfast.
