Text: My wife and I stayed two nights at this beautiful property.  We spoke to the owners a couple of times and they were extremely friendly.  Great little common room with a pool table, bar and games.   We met some other guests and had a nice conversation.  The rooms were very nice and the breakfast was excellent.  Go to the wineries and bring a bottle or two back so you can sit and look out on the beautiful view.

Text: We've stayed at Up Up and Away multiple times while in Hermann. The house is more then impressive, the food is great, and the hosts are wonderful. This is the bed and breakfast to stay at while in Hermann, no doubt. I recommend Up Up and Away to anyone who wants to fully enjoy their weekend in Hermann.

Text: Up Up and Away is a beautiful bed and breakfast with several living areas. I went with my mom and sisters and some other friends to celebrate my mom's birthday. We stayed in the loft area, which was private and quiet. We spent a lot of time in the Common Area of the house playing games, snacking and talking. Breakfast wasn't speculation but it was more than any of us would ever make for breakfast. We used the trolley to take us to the wineries, but didn't realize this B&B was considered outside of town and cost more to ride, but it was worth it. We enjoyed our time here and especially loved the Old English Sheepdog the owners have who liked to make an appearance. We would definitely stay here again.

Text: My boyfriend and I went here for our 1 year anniversary and it was beautiful! Unfortunately it was snowing heavily and the taxi services weren't running. The owners were wonderful and picked us up from the train station and even stopped at a grocery store so we could pick up some stuff for dinner. The room was amazing! We stayed in the loft suite above the garage so it was private and the view was beautiful. Highly recommended!
