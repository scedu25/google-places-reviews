Text: This was the best hotel stay I've had in years.  Excellent service, amenities and over all experience.  It'd be hard to beat for the cost. ????

Text: My family visits Lincoln several times a year and we ALWAYS try to stay here. The hotel staff is consistently friendly, helpful, and will work with you for any special accommodations needed. The rooms are always clean and cozy and breakfast is always something to look forward to with things like Greek yogurt parfaits, biscuits and gravy, eggs, fresh fruit, bagels and more! The pool and hot tub are nice and we have had several family times in the conference room and around the fire outside. I can't say enough good things about this place. I hope your stay is as good as our years of experience!

Text: Loved it. Great Marriott experience. Walking distance to a cool brewery. Friendly people.  Off the interstate about 15 minutes, but if you need a break from a long drive or just want to feel like a human half-way through a cross-country trip, this is a great place to go to.
