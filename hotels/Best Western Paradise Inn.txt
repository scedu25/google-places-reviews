Best Western Paradise Inn
Rating: 3
Text: Not too bad for the price I guess. Lobby, breakfast area & the main building was recently remodeled and pretty nice but most of the guest were housed in another building that was a bit run down. Not sure why someone would remodel and then not let customers stay in the nicer building? Good location with lots of restaurants in the vicinity. Nice pool and playground. B-/C+ in my opinion.

Text: Overall a very nice hotel. The staff was very nice and expedient. The bathroom has some mold around the edges and the soap holder was broken off in the shower. Also there was a plunger next to the toilet with old dried toilet paper on it. Kind of grossed me out.

Text: I stayed in the main building and they had clearly renovated fairly recently. It looked great! My room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and all amenities were in good working order. I was very pleasantly surprised at the high quality of this location compared to what I expected. Kudos!

Text: Hotel was very clean, nice ambiance.  Rooms are comfortable.  The beds, pillows and linens surpass some of the 5 star hotels I have stayed in New York!  Great location, close to highway, food and drugstore.  Very nice pool and hot tub.

Text: I am very pleased with the hotel. The location, staff and overall service is appreciable.  But got disappointed with the BestWestern HQ survey  questionnaire, format and length of the survey. I changed low rating back to 5 as the manager responded and truly survey length/format is not this hotel's fault.
