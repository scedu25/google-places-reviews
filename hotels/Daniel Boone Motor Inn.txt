Text: It's an old place and they are working hard to get it up to date.  Staff is very friendly and any kind of maintenance problems are handled promptly.  I have stayed there twice and I have had no problems with anything.  You have a good restaurant right there called the windmill and you have all kinds of shopping and other eateries within a mile.  I personally find it peaceful and pretty comfortable.

Text: The worst hotel I've ever stayed in... In any country. Front desk staff were rude, card machine doesn't accept international cards (Visa, Mastercard etc). The room was disgusting, sheets dirty, floor was filthy, thin walls, CRT TV (belongs in an antique shop). I get the place is cheap, but I at least expect the place to be clean and the staff to at least try to smile. Spend £10 more at home to Holiday Inn.

Text: Was very surprised. Shows you can take something bad and make it good again.  Yes it is a older motel, but our room was spotless, the bed was comfortable and it was quite. Will gladly stay  there again. For those who felt unsafe place you chair under the door.
