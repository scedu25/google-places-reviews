The Pines At Tuttle Crossing
Rating: 5
Text: I recently moved to the Pines in September of 2017,  prior to moving i was able to get a detailed tour on each Phase along with the workout center that was very up to date. Each phase also had up to date appliances with lots of space for my wife and daughter which is a huge plus. Also i noticed that its a very quite and friendly community and the staff makes you feel at home. Thank you

Text: I have been residing here since June 2017 and must state so far everything is awesome. Leasing office staff Walter, Lesley then the Manager Cody all are amazing and there to help constantly. Must state Maintenance here at Pines is remarkable, all our work order requests were taken care of on time.I would say the only little area of improvement which is required in the apartment complex at this moment is fully equipped GYM and 24*7 clubhouse.

Recently i did a tour with Leslie Morris who was extremely helpful and went the extra mile to assure we had every detail needed on each apartment, she made me and my husband feel very welcoming. I look forward to moving into the pines very soon! Thank you
