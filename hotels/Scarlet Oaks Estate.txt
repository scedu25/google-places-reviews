Scarlet Oaks Estate
Rating: 5
Text: My wife and I recently had a wedding at Scarlet Oaks.  This is one of the most beautiful outdoor venues in this part of Ohio.  They did an excellent job with setup and delivered exactly what was promised.  We received nothing but great feedback from our guests and people loved the overall layout of the event.  You will not be disappointed if you choose to have your wedding or party at Scarlet Oaks Estate.

Text: I attended a wedding here for a family member here and I was a beautiful place.  Absolutely stunning.  But how ever the management was not the best.  The wedding started and the party was getting rushed. So much that the mothers of the bride or groom didn't get seated.  One of the flowers girls (one of the brides daughters) didn't get to walk down as well.  Completely unprofessional.
