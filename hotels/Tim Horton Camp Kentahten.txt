Text: I wish that I could go back to this camp because I wanted to discover my best, but I had a fantastic time and I would love to do this all over again and do at least 1-2 months there and when I am 18 I am going to try to work there as a counselor. I love it there, I got to finally open up and show everybody who I really am. I miss it there. I am from G5 and I miss my counselor so much. It was so much fun getting to meet everyone.

Text: Amazing! My daughter just came home from camp Kentahten. She had the greatest time.  First off, the camp was very informative on what to bring to camp, travel instructions, and contact information. The counselors were very friendly and reassuring at the pick up/drop off location. They were accommodating to my daughter. They also made a very big impact on her. She cried more when she came home than when she left. Her counselors were amazing as well as other staff. My daughter was assigned to a small group which made it easier to make friends. She brought home a wonderful scrapbook and so many memories. She wishes she can go again but I don't think that is allowed. This was an amazing opportunity for my daughter. She came back a different kid. I'm thankful for everything.
