Text: Nice place to stay.. This is not modern but not old.. The kitchen is a little dirty and needs some deeper cleaning but 4 people fit into it very well..

Text: Simple, basic and very clean. Park right outside the door.  Very, very quiet and the bed was comfy. Nice hosts. Small, just passing through, rooms and larger ones with kitchenettes for longer stays. Super good price. I'll stay again when in Leamington. NO bugs.
