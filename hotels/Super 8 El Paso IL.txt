Super 8 El Paso IL

Text: We take a trip 2 times a year with 2 adults and 4 kids.  This year we were stuck for over 2 1/2 hours in traffic due to a tipped over semi.  We arrived at the hotel after 2am.  The staff was so helpful in getting us checked in quickly.  They offered us another hour for check out in the morning without us asking/hinting.  The staff was so friendly and helpful both days.  Not the fake friendly, but the I think of you as a friend. To make things better they then provided us breakfast when we arrived to breakfast after they were almost done putting it all away.  I have never in my life had a better experience.  The great prices might scare some people, but they are awesome rooms.  This will always be our hotel.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
