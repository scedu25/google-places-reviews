Text: Nice big and clean rooms.  Only problem with the room was that the bathroom was so small you had to step out just to change your mind. It has an indoor 'heated' pool, but it was to cold to use. The hot tub was nice. Lena at the front desk was great.

Text: Wonderful place to stay for the price. The pool is a little small but our two younger kids had a lot of fun. Had a little trouble with one of out room keys not working. And a little slow Sunday morning refilling breakfast. But overall we had a great experience. Would definitely stay again.

Text: It was a very nice overnight stay. Breakfast was very good with many options (all tasty!). The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Nothing extravagant as far as amenities - but my family and I would definitely stay there again.

Text: Really nice staff. Beautiful lobby (love the bubbles). Room clean and beds were comfortable. Internet was very poor, (was on second floor--256) requested 'top' floor due to being a light sleeper. People above us were, apparently, unable to sleep. It is an award winner.

Text: Hotel was nice, had a smell at first, but once the air was moving, no problem. Staff were super friendly.  Breakfast was good both days.
