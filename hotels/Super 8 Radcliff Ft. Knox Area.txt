Super 8 Radcliff Ft. Knox Area
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed the night a the Super 8 in Radcliff while visiting Ft. Knox. It is located right off of post. I was surprised at how clean the motel was. The rooms have nice flooring that looks like wood instead of the nasty carpet that other motels have. The shower was clean. The water was hot and had really good water pressure. The night staff and the staff the next morning were nice. The price is reasonable and they do give military discounts.

Text: The room seemed relatively clean except for the floors. The staff was very friendly and overall it was a good experience. For the price, I would stay again.

Text: Check in was really easy, quick and friendly service. The room was a bit small, but it was perfect for myself and my fiance. The air conditioning and the heat both work very well. Complimentary soap, shampoo, and conditioner were provided. Breakfast was free, small selection, but can't complain. Staff was very friendly. They do have a guest laundry room to be able to do your own laundry. Hotel is well kept, as the owner lives there himself.

Text: We were chasing the eclipse!  This was the last room we could find available.  Room was adequate.  We believed we were reserving a first floor room but we were stuck on the second floor with no elevator.  This caused some difficulty.  If you are a non-smoker, don't stay here.  The smoking area are literally beside the doors.  You MUST walk thru the smokers to get in the door.  I ended up with swollen puffy eyes and congestion.  You can't hold your breath long enough to get thru it.
