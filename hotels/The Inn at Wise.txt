The Inn at Wise

Text: Don't go very often, but when I do it's almost devoid of patrons. Menu is limited. Atmosphere is somewhat austere. I guess most prefer the Pub and Tap room on the lower level. Same menu. Smaller and more intimate. Closed Sunday and Monday.

Text: Awesome hotel with an awesome staff that ensures your stay is wonderful. The rooms are well appointed.  You can feel the history of the property. Hearing the natural  creaking sound in the original wood floors  as you walk across them remind me of  the wood floors from 50 years ago. Wonderful experience! Plan to return again!!

Text: Absolutely LOVED this place! It's old, but the updating they've done is perfect! You can still enjoy the charm of this historic building's creaky hardwood floors and the preserved architecture without sacrificing hotel quality. There's now a complimentary breakfast and the restaurant food was still being served when we checked in at 8:20. We loved the charm of the basement pub and look forward to coming back! Great deal for what we paid!!!

Text: Very clean and well appointed rooms. All the staff that helped us during our stay were very friendly, attentive and cheerful. Basement PUB is cozy with a wide offering of craft beer and premium liquors. The night we stopped in the PUB an amazing local talent was entertaining the patrons. Thoroughly enjoyed her set. (Britney Carter ~ If Birds Could Fly) Breakfast was listed as a 'Continental Breakfast' but actually a good selection of eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy and waffles. Charming

Text: This was our first visit here. They have decent room prices! The staff is very friendly.  There are 3 restaurants in the hotel and a few other options in walking distance. They have a covered parking garage. The rooms are very nice and updated.
