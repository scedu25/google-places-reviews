Text: This place was disgusting! After losing my debt card we went to the room. Didn't look great when I walked in the room. I went to lock the door and realized the lock was gone and saw three large holes.  I then tried to hook up to the WiFi and entered the password and it wouldn't connect at all. I went into the bathroom and there was something splattered up the wall. There were cigarette burns all over the ceiling above the mirror. There was no remote for the TV so I looked around for the remote and opened a drawer on the TV stand and the drawer fell off of the stand not the whole drawer just the wood part with the handle. I opened a door on the stand and found an old refrigerator with gray/black mold growing on the inside. When I asked for a refund they tried telling me no refund after we got into an argument they had me show them the room. When I showed them the refrigerator they said " Oh we don't use that one any more". After showing that I had photo proof they gave me a refund.
