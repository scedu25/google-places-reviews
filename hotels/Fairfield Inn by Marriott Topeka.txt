Text: This might have been an issue with my room but the walls seemed a little thin. I could hear the neighbors talking from time to time but it wasn't a serious issue (again, hardly noticeable for the most part). Everything else was exceptional. Friendly staff, clean rooms, complementary warm food for breakfast. Nice place to stay if passing through.

Text: Room was average. Location was kind of annoying to get to. Service was nice and accommodating. Free wifi is slow. If you want better wifi you have to pay.

Text: We had some problems, to which the desk listened and tried to compensate for.  The real 5-star service was when they called to tell me that housekeeping had found that I had left shirts and a jacket in the closet. They expressed them to me without charge!
