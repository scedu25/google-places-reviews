Best Western Morton Grove Inn
Rating: 3
Text: An inexpensive, clean, busy motel. The breakfast (eggs, bacon, cereal, etc.) is free. The mini bagel, fresh fruit and coffee are vegan. Our recently remodeled room was clean and comfortable. Except for breakfast there are no amenities. The location is perfect for our visit with family and friends. We have stayed many times over the years.  The quietest rooms are on the back side of the hotel, off the alley. Wheelchair accessible. Free parking.

Text: The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room had been recently updated, and looked nice. We had breakfast, and while the selection was not overly large, it was a good value.
My only complaint is that the photos and description of the hotel on the website do not make it clear that all guest room doors are exterior. Had I known this, I would not have booked this hotel.

Text: I highly recommend staying at Best Western of Morton Grove.  This is the fourth year in a row I have stayed at Best Western of Morton Grove, because it is an excellent location for me to visit my family and friends. The prices for a night stay is reasonable and the rooms are excellent. Also, it is walking distance to the train station that will take you into Union Station downtown Chicago.
