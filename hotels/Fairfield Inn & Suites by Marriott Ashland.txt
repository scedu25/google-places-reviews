Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Ashland
Rating: 5
Text: We used Fairfield Inn and Suites for our wedding. Though we had a couple bumps at first, the manager was amazing! She helped us get everything just right and was very accommodating. The rooms and everything was so clean and comfortable and the staff was very nice. I would definitely recommend staying here!

Text: Great stay. Professional and friendly staff. Rooms are spacious and clean. Indoor pool. Wifi is fast enough for streaming. Breakfast is included. Its about 5 miles out of I-64 but its worth it. They do offer military government rates.

Text: Perfect place to stay while on business trip. However, some points for improvement: The room was smelling socks. Need to freshen it when the resident checks out. Breakfast being served as complimentary, but needs to be improved. The boiled eggs were served cold and the scrambled eggs did not taste the way they are supposed to be

Text: Odd to see some giving low scores.   This meets everything I expect at the Fairfield level in the Marriott brand. Quiet location as well. Clean and feels new even though I know it has been here for a bit.
