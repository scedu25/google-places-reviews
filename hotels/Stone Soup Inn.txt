Stone Soup Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Beautiful, cosy, elegant, spacious, welcoming, historic. I wish that I could live here. The kind and accommodating staff, easy check-in, exquisitely clean, thoughtfully decorated with Art Deco-era ceramics, huge rooms, a full breakfast... I'd choose Stone Soup Inn over a typical hotel in Indianapolis any day. Made my business trip all the better.

Text: This is one of the best B&B in the area. The owners are amazing and will do anything to make your stay as perfect as possible.

Text: I reserved the Stone Soup Inn. The individual there was there to greet but failed to greet other visitors. The breakfast was poor. Also the television was super small. I urge you NOT to go here unless you want a somewhat continental breakfast. Then to make things worst they add additional bogus fees. They don't know why the fees are on there and Genine could not help me with that. She just gave me the run around! IF YOU WANT FEES CHARGED that are BOGUS stay here!

Text: The Innkeeper was very nice and hospitable. The room was beautiful and very clean. We only stayed one night for a show that was in town, but Stone Soup Inn made a great impression!
