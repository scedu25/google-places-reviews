Text: It's not a 5 star hotel. But it's perfect at what it is. It's the one and only clean, quiet, basic hotel I could find. It's a place to lay your head. That's it. Nothing fancy but clean and polite. And did I mention quiet... it's only a block away from the ruckus but somehow misses it. We walked by a dozen other places in the morning and most were still cleaning up from the drunks. My kids and I stayed in the right spot. Couldn't be happier.
