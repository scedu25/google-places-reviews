Hampton Inn & Suites Indianapolis-Airport
Rating: 5
Text: I didn't actually stay here, but I attended a 3 day class that was being taught in one of the conference rooms. Staff was friendly, great continental breakfast. Coffee, leader and unleaded as well as hot water for tea or hot coco is available all day. I didn't see anyone in the pool but the area looked nice and clean. Very close to the airport with restaurants and big box stores close by.

Text: Always start with the toplines-  Clean, well appointed, courteous and professional staff, very good breakfast, spacious room and bathroom.  Now the details - Beautiful lobby. There were two smiling, professional, hospitable, presentable agents at the front desk even at 9:30 at night.  Check in was lightning quick.  Elevator, clean (although the door had a really loud squeak as was closing.) I had a handicap accessible room.  It was a clean, smelling fresh, spacious room.   Almost felt guilty having all that room to myself.  Breakfast offerings were standard but slightly better than I expected, (omelets, french toast sticks.)  Coffee was tasty and the most important thing for me - the breakfast area was kept very clean.  Spills, drips, and crumbs were wiped up right away.  I will return.

Text: It's clean and it's nice.  Nothing overly fancy,  nor is it a budget hotel.  It's comfortable. My co-worker was a high level member and was given a water bottle and treat.  I was traveling with him and checked in at the same time and was offered nothing. Over the top customer service would have been to sacrifice $2 to offer the same perk

Whenever we had a question the staff was so kind to answer with a smile. Breakfast area was huge and had lots of options. Overall, wonderful experience. For sure 5 stats and would highly recommend!
