Text: Great place. We only came to play a few rounds of roulette and get dinner before hitting the road. Won 400 bucks in roulette, had a couple drinks then we went to the steakhouse. The food was amazing. Had the $80 porterhouse. It was worth every penny. Mashed potatoes were also amazing. Great service, great food, great people. Would definitely go back, wish we could have stayed longer.

Text: The Great Exposition Buffet My dining party enjoyed the all-you-can-eat Crab Legs dinner buffet late on Saturday afternoon. Arriving at 3:30pm, we did not have a line to wait in and we were able to immediately pay for our meal and be seated. Besides crab legs, the buffet offered a large variety of food: Pizza, prime rib, sushi, fried chicken, orange chicken, steamed vegetables, roasted vegetables, etc. In addition, there was a salad bar with an assortment of choices applicable to a "lighter" diet. Last, the buffet offered a large variety of dessert options (cheesecake, creme brule, etc.) including multiple flavors of ice cream and sundae toppings. Due to the higher price of the "crab leg" buffet ($34.95), we took our time with dinner in order to sample and enjoy everything that caught our fancy. All in all, the food was quite good. The wait staff did an excellent job of clearing the table of used plates and keeping our drinks fresh. At the end of dinner, as we were eating dessert, we were offered coffee (nice touch). Leaving, some time later, we noted that the line to get I to the buffet was INCREDIBLY longer. Upon seeing that, we were happy that we chose to dine as early as we had. While I would rate the buffet as being worth the price of admission, I would probably not elect to go to the crab one again. I personally don't usually eat the amount of food that would justify the cost of that meal. I believe the regular dinner buffet is closer to the $15 mark and that would have been better for me. But if you choose the crab leg buffet and don't mind the cost, you should not be disappointed. All those people waiting in the wrap around line we passed as as we left would agree.

Text: My family & I visited this location because I am in town & wanted some crab legs. We had a party of 20 in our group. Once half us arrived they allowed us to be seated. We had a rock star waitress that was AMAZING. Along with our 3 tables & several others she didn't miss a beat. Several of us waited around & insisted we talk to a manager to say she went way above her customer services status. Job well done!

Text: Love the bathroom amenities! Knock your socks off for a casino ;) [where they're gambling that you're paying anything for room anyway...] 
Update from last visit. Must have not stayed on this floor this room was much better than the others I recommend 7th floor. 
I also want to reiterate what I have said in a survey sent to me by the Casino. Their valet staff is hands down the best in the city. I don't know where they screen them from, how that selection process works but I tell you what it is IMPORTANT! That is the first and last experience a person has leaving the hotel & casino and a great experience there makes a world of difference! 
Why I changed my rating from a 3 to a 5 ??Kudos??

Text: Upon entering the casino I was first impressed with the cleanliness and pleasant smell. We ate at the little burger joint where we enjoyed a juicy turkey burger and chili cheese fries. They have a daily short list offering of shake flavors. Neither flavor offered that day appealed to me, unfortunately. Overall, a decent experience for me.
