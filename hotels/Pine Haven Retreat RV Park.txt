Pine Haven Retreat RV Park

Text: What this lacks in amenities, it makes up for in hospitality.
Bare bones park, all grass as in
mowed field. 
Owners very friendly, came over in 
morning with homemade cheese.

Text: Pine Haven was a great place to stay. The people are friendly, and we enjoyed the wooded atmosphere. I'd come again.

Text: Not really well maintained place. Office with showers and toilets is some sort of disused clubhouse. I stayed there for one night in the tent. No other RVs except some jackass who was idling a semi at the reststop next door all night. I've been at shittier places, but it's 10 bux, so it's pretty good to me.

Oh, there are no pines that I could see.
