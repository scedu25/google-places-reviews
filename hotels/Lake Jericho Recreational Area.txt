Lake Jericho Recreational Area
Rating: 4
Text: I discovered Lake Jericho about 3 weeks ago.  Been there three times and had a wonderful experience each time.  I SUP on the water, hiked the trails, chatted with the staff at the gate house and walked around the campsite.  The bathroom facilities are rustic and dampened my enthusiasm about tent camping but I do love the day trips I have made there this fall.

Text: awful and rude!  i cant believe it!  was passing through in rv coming from nephews graudation.  they took my 10 bucks to dump and refill my water.  i didnt see where the water was to refill so i drove to the office to ask.  an employee was rude to me and then she kicked me out saying it was dark and they were closed.  when i told them i came for the water they said then pay to stay overnight!!!!    i was 45 minutes into my drive i just wanted me water.  they said no refund and made me leave or threatened to escourt me.  horrible people!
