Cobblestone Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: On the edge of town, but nothing in town is that far. Nice new build with clean rooms. There's a nice sports bar within walking distance that probably has one of the better beer selections in town.

Text: I booked this for 2 of our counselors s to stay for a conference.  I think the stay was fine, but when I tried to get a receipt and the sales tax credited (since we were charged in error after providing tax exempt information), the manager (Tammy) was extremely unprofessional.  I've now emailed 3 times and called 3 times (the only response I've gotten is when the manager actually answered the phone).  It's not appropriate to be told about the "doubles and triples" she has to work and that's why she won't be able to help me.  Her customer service skills are lacking and I didn't appreciate her rudeness.

Text: Tammy is a nasty individual and needs to be replaced before this decent hotel is run straight to the ground. Won’t be visiting here until she is replaced, she lacks basic customer service skills, treats the staff like trash, and acts like everyone is beneath her! Get rid of her, you may be surprised to see how financially lucrative and beneficial it would be to this hotel!

Text: We had the BEST front desk lady but the manager Tammy is not friendly at all when I called to her to tell her nice we were treated by her employee she says " ok so what can I help you with" the lady at the front desk should be running the place.

Text: Rooms were definitely not newly renovated.  Beds sag in the middle and unclean. When we decided not to stay manager refused to refund our money. In all our traveling we have never been treated so unkind and rude.  This is a zero star rating hotel.
