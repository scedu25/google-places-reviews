Text: Most of the Ladies are nice. Which is the ONLY reasoni rate this place as high as a 2*  There are some recenty remodeled rooms that are better than..... But had one room with very poor water flow. Second one had drain problems. Third one we killed a roach!

Text: All I can say is that if I was paying for my stay I would not stay here, the company I work for owns this motel so they always have us stay here at no cost. 
Staff is rude, never smile.
We stayed 2 nights and never got our room cleaned, not even new towels....
Good size rooms and good water presure in. The shower.

Text: Smells like an old lady been smoking in my room since she was twelve.  Horrible room, tried to rate it no stars.  One star would have been to good.

Text: Fairly standard hotel. A little old looking but everything was clean. We got a non-smoking room but it smelled like smoke
