Recess Inn Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Our group were the only guests for the evening so we kind of had free reign of the place. We played games in the library late into the night and slept in. The inn keeper cooked up a delicious breakfast at the time of our choosing. Left full and rested! Make sure you eat before you check in or bring food as there is not a restaurant in town.
