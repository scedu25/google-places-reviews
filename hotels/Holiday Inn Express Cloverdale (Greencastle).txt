Text: I stay here anytime I take my husband down to southern Indiana and I have always had a great experience. This past time I got in a lot later then expected since I have a 3 month old that was traveling with us. When I got in the man at the desk had everything ready for me with a room key and was very grateful. Made my night so much easier. Breakfast is always good and it's quiet when we need to sleep. Very nice hotel. Only thing I would say is the cleanliness could be a little better this past time but other times were better.

Text: Best hotel experience ever! We made a last minute stop last night. We had just came from three days of staying at an awful hotel in St. Louis. I thought I could drive straight home to Pittsburgh but my eyes had other plans.  Andrew made the check in so easy and he made us smile again. The beds were so comfy and the whole place was clean. We finally slept good. In the morning breakfast was great. My son loved the pancake making machine. He wants one to take to college with him!  Everyone was so super friendly. And the price was great too. If I ever drive to St. Louis again I will be sure to stop again.

Text: The rooms had 2 beds per room that could fit 2 per bed. Then the bathrooms were pretty large and a nice tv in every room. Also, there was a pretty good lobby area with a good breakfast.

Text: The place is nice. The hotel staff when we checked tried to be clever. She was trying to give us only one room. We had paid in advance for two rooms. On insisting she finally gave us two rooms.

Text: Stayed here to visit lots of family in surrounding areas. Just your basics here, but very clean and comfortable with nice pool. Staff was awesome, very friendly and attentive to every need. Justin at the front desk was awesome helping us find extra rooms for some of our family to stay so we could spend more time together.
