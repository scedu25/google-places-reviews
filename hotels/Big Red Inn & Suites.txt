Text: If you stay here be prepared to find no live manager on the premises;  all communication is by cell phone.  The rooms are dark and gloomy with dark maroon color scheme.  TV didn't work, but there was a full kitchen in room, which we used.  Best (only) place to dine in Laurel on Sat night:  Cedarview Country Club.

Text: We stay 100-125 nights a year in motels, so I see alot of motels.  We stayed here the other night, when we were passing through Laurel.  The rooms are as the other reviewer says dark and gloomy.  It was a nice large room with a kitchenette, however, the a/c unit was in the front room and therefore, the bedrooms, which were in the back, had no a/c, not even ceiling fans.  The bathtub looked like it had NEVER been cleaned.  I almost felt dirtier AFTER I took a shower in there.  There also was NO hot water, whatsoever.  You had to turn the hot water tap all the way on and leave the cold off, to get an even lukewarm shower.  My poor brother went last and he got an ice cold shower.  There is no WI-FI, if you want WI-FI, you have to spend more money and stay at their location down the street.  The room is not worth the rate they charge.  I have stayed at nice Hampton Inns for that price and got breakfast and free WI-FI included.  I was going to say something to the manager upon check out, but when I went into the office, noone was there.  Just a sign that said to call them to reserve rooms.   Go figure.  There is also no place to eat in town.  We tried to go to breakfast at a bar and by the time we parked and walked up to it, they had locked the doors.  The locals said they close at 9 a.m. and that the only other place we could get breakfast was at the Cenex Truck Stop.
