Towne Motel
Rating: 5
Text: This is a very clean and nice looking motel. The grounds are always kept up, the rooms are great, they have laundry facilities on premises plus ice machine. This is a American owned motel and I love that. I work out of state and I've been here for five months and have nothing but good things to say. A very quiet motel and other patrons are nice. No rift rafts at this place, you will not regret staying here. Also,that guy named Michael messenger is a liar, he has not one good thing to say about any place he has stayed, matter of fact he can't stay at any Establishment around here because of his filth, we don't allow pigs here.

Text: My husband and I have been staying at this hotel for a few years now.  We love this hotel and the staff.  The rooms are always nice and clean.  We have never had any complaints about this hotel and may I add their prices are very affordable.  We will continue staying at this hotel? because the owners are good honest people.

Text: The owners are super friendly and accommodating. I brought my dog and they were very understanding about her destroying some of their towels. The rooms are very clean although the walls are pretty thin. Close to town. Altogether a nice, quiet place to stay.
