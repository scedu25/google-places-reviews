Text: This place has the best restaurant in the basement!! On Fri, Sat, Sun they have a bottomless pasta deal that are big portions upon itself! We usually eat one serving there and then order one to go! Try their house wine which is $25? a bottle. Very yummy Riesling

Text: Excellent experience. Clean and comfortable rooms, friendly and helpful staff. I used IHG rewards points towards the room, so it was supposed to be a free night. I realized a few days later that my credit card had also been charged for the room. I called the hotel and they promptly reversed the charge and apologized for the mistake. The person I spoke with even went so far as to thank me for bringing it to their attention at all! I was really impressed with how helpful and professional they were in fixing the situation. Thank you!

Text: Lots of plugs and even USB ports in the room, comfy bed, got a handicap room so don't know what the regular rooms are like. Shower sucked due to it not being a normal one. Hotel staff was friendly but maid staff wouldn't stop trying to enter my room after I told them I wasn't checking out until later.

Text: Slighty nicer renovated rooms. Staff is nice...food is good at hotel restaurant. The only thing that made my blood boil is the inexperienced "manager" at the Tivoli restaurant who expected me to pay for another prosseco, after I accidentally spilled it. I've always worked in restaurants and bars...and I've never expected a paying customer to pay for another drink or another plate of food, if they accidentally spilled or dropped it. Other than that, I like this place enough to come back.
