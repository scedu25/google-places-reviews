Koza House
Rating: 5
Text: I attended a "Lodge and Learn" program at Koza House, featuring Velga Easker demonstrating her amazing artworks made from postage stamps, envelopes and other materials typically found in what the rest of us consider "junk mail." It was an extremely inspiring session, accompanied by delicious food and beverages, and enhanced by the beautiful surroundings and ambiance of Koza House. I would recommend the "Lodge and Learn" programs at Koza House to anyone looking for a relaxing break in an unforgettable B&B, with the added benefit of learning a new skill and having a good time!
