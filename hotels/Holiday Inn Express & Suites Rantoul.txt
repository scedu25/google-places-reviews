Text: I travel a lot for work and use IHG for my choice of hotels when i am on the road. I have to say this is probably the best HIE i have ever stayed at. Clean lobby, A+ service from everyone at the front desk rooms were clean. I wish all HIE were as nice and friendly as this location.

Text: The room itself was nice and clean and whoever my husband dealt with onsite was very helpful. However, their phone customer service is terrible and uniformed. I called to book a room for my cousins wedding. They were completely oblivious to the block of rooms that she had booked for guests. I booked a room anyhow and was told they would call if they found the reserved rooms. I never received a confirmation email so my husband called 2 days later. Still no idea of block of rooms and we had to rebook. We get to the hotel and they don't have our reservation. We were upgraded to a king suite at a lower cost. Awesome! It's now 6 days post wedding and I get a second charge on my card for more than the room amount. Call. No idea what's going on. "Oh it shows that you didn't show for your reservation." Give me a break! After 20min they finally refund the money. Let me add that my sister had called twice and got the same run around. Ended up booking online. My parents didn't have an issue booking in the block of rooms. I don't get it!
