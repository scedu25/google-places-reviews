Fairway Apartments
Rating: 5
Text: I lived at The Fairway for a year and it was by far, the best complex I've lived in Lafayette/West Lafayette. Great price for the location and such large, open rooms.  The community was nice and quiet as well.  Less than a five minute drive to Purdue. And the celery bog/park is a short 20 minute walk away as well. Management was excellent as well. Whenever we had a maintenance issue, it was handled quickly and efficiently. If I ever moved back to the area, it would be here.

Text: Great complex that does frequent updates throughout the property and great location to Purdue. Maintenance is always quick and reliable and office staff is always friendly and willing to help! Definitely would recommend to anyone looking in the area!

Text: The staff has been great! I have been here for almost 4 years and have loved the new management and the new staff! They have been nothing but helpful.  I never really had any maintenance issues, but when my dryer decided to stop working, they were able to get me up and running within a few hours! Maintenance was very nice and informative!  Unfortunately, I am transferring with a new job, I really hope I can find another apartment on the West Coast with the same kind of friendly, knowledgeable staff. I would recommend The Fairway Apartments to anyone!
