Day's Inn and Suites

Text: There were some issues...it was good place for the most part. The clerks were fine, comfy beds and nice hot shower. The pool was great as well. However, not all of the outlets worked in the room (my phone didn't charge, was almost late to my appointment) and the shower rod was coming apart from the wall. Breakfast was okay,  but the coffee machine only had decaf and hot water. The housekeepers were rude...we tried to wish them good morning and they looked at us but didn't say anything to us, just to each other.
