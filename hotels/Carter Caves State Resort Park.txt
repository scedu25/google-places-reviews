Carter Caves State Resort Park
Rating: 5
Text: Southern hospitality must start at the Ohio River! Every park employee that we encountered was extremely helpful and friendly. This is a beautiful hidden gem in the Kentucky State Park system. We visited on a quiet Monday in October and experienced Cascade Cave, X Cave, Natural Bridge Trail and Three Bridges Trail. We enjoyed every bit of it but the Cascade Cave tour with naturalist Paul was definitely a highlight.

Text: I was there for the Carter Caves Haunted Trail. It was probably the best haunted trail I have ever been to. The line was pretty long but it was worth it. It was also very well priced at $10. I would recommend this seasonal attraction to anyone .

Text: Carter Caves State Park is great. The park is beautiful, there are many outdoor activities, and the restaurant in the lodge is great. There is a golf course, swimming pool, putt putt golf, camping areas, cabins, and nice rooms in the lodge, as well as the many cave tours. There is a really nice gift shop on the way into the park. Carter Caves also has activities throughout the year, as well as concerts and plays in the amphitheatre.

Text: A beautiful Park and great caves. We enjoyed staying at the lodge. The food was okay but not as good as we hoped. There are several hiking trails and there is a golf course.
