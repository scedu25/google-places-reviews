Hampton Inn Kansas City/Blue Springs
Rating: 3
Text: Our room smelled badly. Luckily they were not booked full so we were able to switch rooms. It is an older property so it needs a little updating. The housekeeping staff was super friendly and very helpful. ( They get 5 stars! ) The breakfast hostesses were more concerned with visiting with each other than the quests. We have come to expect the best from our Hilton properties and this one was just OK

Text: We've  traveled from Maine to Colorado and back through the southern states.  We stayed at Hampton Inns exclusively.  I won't stay here again.  The place needs better cleaning help. We were disappointed with the cleanliness of the room.  Hilton is better than that.  Take your name away from this place.

Text: The Hampton Inn at Blue Springs is right off the highway, but the rooms are very quiet. The beds are very comfortable with the best pillows ever. Everything was clean. The staff were all extremely polite. And in the morning, there's a great breakfast buffet. It looks small, but they provide everything you could possibly want and it is tasty.
