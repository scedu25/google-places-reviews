Text: Had a fantastic trail ride! They give you a little freedom with the horse which is way better than having to stay in line with a horse that does everything (which is how other trail rides I have been on are like). All the horses are very well trained and behaved. The people who work there are super nice and helpful too!!

Beautiful place to escape from the business of life!

Text: I was disappointed with my horseback ride at the flying W ranch in the Flint hills of Kansas. I was thinking that going on a two hour ride would be a good test to see if I wanted to return for a stay. It would have been nice if one of the owners Josh or Gwen had come along to add some luster and history to the group. Their female wrangler and Daughter led us but were rather lack luster and going through the routine. two of the horses had open wounds that went unattended which apparently came from being carted from their pasture. some were also dirty and could have been groomed. I don't think this lack of attention is the norm in the wild west. We also spent a lot of time waiting for everyone to be mounted up .there were kids and adults of all riding levels. The horses were well trained and probably had the routine down from regular use .My horse was nothing to write home about. My husband a beginner was falling off his horse and the saddle was going with him which I would guess comes from not having the girth tight enough . No one checked girths. I asked for a canter and some of us were allowed a short canter and that was it. Not very exciting but the two pastures we went through and back tracked home were very green and lovely. The horses were trucked back as they came with no medicinal ointment on those wounds. It seemed like an all round laissez faire attitude as was the ride, just passable nothing great, nothing impressed me or enticed me to return. It was suggested that gratuities be given which they were but with a mediocre ,expensive ,experience I don't think it is fair to ask for extras.
