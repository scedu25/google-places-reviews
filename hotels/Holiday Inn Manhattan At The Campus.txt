Holiday Inn Manhattan At The Campus

Text: Some of this place is a little outdated and the pool needs better water treatment. BUT overall great stay, out of all the places I've stayed in Manhattan this place has the best room and shower. Fantastic complementary breakfast. Attached to best dining spot. Over all best so far in the area.

Text: This is the view from my room. The staff was excellent! Check in was smooth, bill was accurate, a tiny room issue was fixed, and the shuttle at 4:45am to the airport was as friendly as it can be.

Text: The room was very nice. Much bigger than normal hotel rooms. Overall, it was a good stay, but the shower didn't work in the morning.

Text: Room was big, and very clean. Our bathroom had a jacuzzi tub in addition to a shower and it was awesome. Wouldn't mind staying here again.
