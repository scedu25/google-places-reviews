Text: Staff is very courteous and friendly. Just say good morning and you will get a genuine smile. Breakfast is great. They kept the gravy and sausage topped off and the whole area clean. My room was spotless and the smoke free policy keeps the air fresh. The price is right. This is not give stars for luxury. But is five star value and home away from home.

Text: For a lower price hotel,  this one is very nice. Very clean and well maintained. Breakfast is above average for this type of property. This is the second time we have stayed there and will stay there again.

Text: This is the Cleanest Comfort Inn I've stayed at! When I walked in,  the first thing I noticed, was it had a nice, clean smell. Staff was friendly, rooms nice. I'd rate it as one of the best ones I've ever stayed in. They have a very good variety for breakfast...and at at a Very reasonable rate, too! We came back on the following Sunday night, and stayed again.  The only odd thing was...clerk was not at the desk upon check in, both times. Had to wait several minutes the first time, not as long on the second stay.
