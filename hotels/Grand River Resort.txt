Text: My husband stayed here for work and when we found out that he would be staying in one of the cabins, we decided to make it into a little family getaway. We had such a great experience! The cabin itself was clean, which definitely matters, and we were pleased with the layout and the feel of the facilities themselves. The place is dated, but for the price and with how well maintained it is, it's definitely a great find. We would love to return, hopefully in a warmer month when we can really enjoy the pool and mini golf. We gladly recommend staying here!

The homemade flavors of Ice cream, sweet treats is  delicious! Great family oriented place! Looking forward to karaoke by the pool tomorrow!

Text: Amazing place, had a blast with the family playing mini golf, swimming, going to the beach across the street. Very clean rooms with plenty of room for our whole family. Lisa the owner was great always there if we needed something or had questions about the area. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.

Text: We stay here a few times a year. We love it! The staff is excellent. The cabins, motel rooms Aframes have been spotless every time. We stayed in cabin 14 this visit and once again not disappointed. If anything is lacking all you have to do is ask and  they will do everything possible to make sure you have it. Will continue to stay here each visit to the area.
