Text: This is a mobile home court, not a house! As with any place you have your problems with people.  But as for this being a trashy place, not by a long shot. You can go into Peru and find trashy places as well. They have been upgrading this place and bringing  in new homes. Maintenance  is finally getting a handle on taking care of the grounds. It's an affordable  way to live when your raising  a family, so your not house poor!

Text: Been trying to get a hold of you guys to look into buying a trailer there. I've called several times during your work hours, but nobody answers the phone. Even went to check out the place and there wasn't anybody at the office either. How am I supposed to get a trailer there if I can't even get a hold of you?
