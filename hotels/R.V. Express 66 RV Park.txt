R.V. Express 66 RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: All paved sites. Clean, nice staff and can walk to restaurants. Nice place to stay. We have stayed here several times. The only reason I didn't give it a five is because the park is next to interstate 44, but we just run our fan all night and we don't have any trouble with noise.

Text: Good place to spend a few days to rest up. Easy access with all concrete pads, very nice lady answers the phone & schedules reservations. Price & cleanliness is outstanding.

Text: Very clean and right off I44, but a little noisie. Weak internet and no shade. Still a nice place.
