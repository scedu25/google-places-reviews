Cadet Motor Inn Coldwater

Text: I reserved the room online and requested two full size beds. After what seemed forever from the unfriendly male who signed me in I entered the room and was only given 1 bed. If you want cable and internet they charge an extra $5  for a room. As.soon as you enter the odor literally almost knocks you out. There is no venelation so the room is stuffy as the odor creeps around. The comforter was dirty and there was a small tv placed across the room on top of a make shift closet with wires hanging all over. An old dresser which most drawers didnt even pull out. This place should be closed for $70 it was a complete rip off.
