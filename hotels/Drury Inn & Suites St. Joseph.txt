Text: Fantastic service! A very good price for all that you get. Very pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. Beautiful rooms, great breakfast and dinner. Never been to a better hotel and I have been to a lot.

Text: Nice hotel. Nothing extremely fancy or special. It was clean and the staff were nice. There wasn't a lot of food options around the hotel within walking distance. Driving a few minutes opens up a lot. It's about 10-15 min outside of downtown.

Text: This was our first Drury Inn experience and LOVED it!  We arrived a little early and our room was not quite ready but with sodas and popcorn on their lobby couches we got to relax as soon as we got there.  The pool area was fantastic to have, the free breakfast and kickback were above and beyond any of my expectations.  The manger on duty was literally everywhere and made us feel like we were the most important people, that was felt throughout the entire hotel.  I am excited to visit more Drury Inn hotels in the US.  Definitely a new favorite hotel!

Text: The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely nice. The kickback dinner and full breakfast make this the best deal around.
