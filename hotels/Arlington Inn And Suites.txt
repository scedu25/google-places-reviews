Arlington Inn And Suites
Rating: 3
Text: Staff at Arlington was very helpful. They allowed my husband and I to park our motorcycles under the covered drive by the front door. The room was affordable. They do not pro ice breakfast, but coffee was available all day.

Text: I booked Motel 6 for 4 nights back in March and was not told that the company was changing hands.  I was told they would be under construction but open.  She gave me confirmation.  I called the hotel to confirm reservations and there were none in my name and the company would not honor the reservation or price.  Found a new hotel.
