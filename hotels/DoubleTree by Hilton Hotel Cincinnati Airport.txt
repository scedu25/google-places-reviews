DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Cincinnati Airport
Rating: 4
Text: We were there 1 day. It was pretty clean, front desk when we checked in was not great. She acted like we did not call and get the charges set or keeping the car there for the week. This morning checking out and the shuttle was good. Kids went swimming, and we were the only ones in there so that was nice.

Text: This is a decent airport hotel. The staff is really friendly, but the rooms are a little outdated. I stayed in room 209 and I couldn't take a shower without the bathtub filling up from drainage issues. There are no safes to secure your valuables. There is also a strange and eerie smell in the hallways. Average stay overall. The lobby is nice however. No fridge in my room but it was booked by my company so I'm not sure if there are more deluxe rooms. Mine had 2 queens I believe.

Text: This is a nice hotel with great staff. The 3 star rating takes into account no guest laundry facilities and no refrigerator in the room. We asked about the refrigerator and we were told they do not have enough for the hotel so they move them from room to room.  I stayed for 3 days and never had one installed.

Text: Staff understood I was sharing a room for business purposes but gave me a suite with a single bed. Thought about using the couch until I saw all the stains. Painstakingly got a new room where only half the lamps worked,a/c was garbage, random stains all over. Almost gave it one star but it is a step above a motel 8 so settled on 2.
