West Inn
Rating: 1
Text: First off, the actual location of the West Inn is about another half mile west down the highway on the south side of the street. Right next to Pine Hills Mobile Home park. Sleeping outside in a tent is a much better option then staying at this place. Don't worry, they already know about the bed bugs..just sleep in your car is all I'm saying.

Text: I will not even give one star.  I was going to camp, but could not find anyplace open.  Their rooms are only $33 per night, but still not worth it.  Very scary place, filthy, and poor everything.
