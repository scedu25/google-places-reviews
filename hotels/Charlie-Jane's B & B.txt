Charlie-Jane's B & B
Rating: 5
Text: They are AWESOME! I have been lucky enough to stay at Charlie and Jane's twice, and both times I had great experiences. They are the definition on hospitality. They are very knowledgable about the area, and everything going on. They are so kind, warm, and welcoming. Their home is built in the late 1800's, and is an absolute stunner! And, we stayed while Iowa was in the single digits (with a negative wind chill) and we were totally comfortable (being a baby from California, I was worried). To top it all off, the breakfast's are incredible! We were full until mid afternoon! Absolutely delicious, nothing feels more like you are on vacation, than waking up to an incredible homemade breakfast! Needless to say, we will be back!
