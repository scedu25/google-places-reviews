Text: Never again. It's a dump. Towels have rusty color and are written on , heat doesn't work , water drains slowly out of one sink can barely run water and the other sink doesn't work at all, bedroom next door has the boxspring and mattress sitting on the floor, crackheads keep you up all night , police are called and throws people out , fights all night , can't lock door from inside , it was just awful .
