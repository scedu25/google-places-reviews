Leisure Lake Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Quiet camping. There's a lake to fish in. Campground is right off the freeway. No pool or activities, just the lake and camping spots. It is well maintained, clean and peaceful. There's a small laundry room. No WiFi.

Text: We stayed at this campground in July of 2014.  It has full hook-ups with sites around a lake.  The owner was very nice and helpful.  The sites were good.  Campers were spread out so no one was on top of each other.   The price was great.  The sunsets on the lake were beautiful.  We would stay there again!

Text: We stayed here the first week of June 2010. Very nice, clean campground on a small lake/large pond. Hosts were very friendly. Only downside is it's by Route 88, the East-West Tollway from Chicago, so there is some road noise. We'd highly recommend this as a place to stay.
