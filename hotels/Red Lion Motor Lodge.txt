Text: Older hotel not bad for an overnight stop.  Not a family place.  Needs to be cleaned and updated.  Good owner operators.  I would stay again. Because of price

Text: Decent motel....room wasn't very clean. I had to wipe down all hard surfaces. Bedspread had dried blood on it. I got a new bedspread, acting night manager extremely rude, and doesn't help at all. Owners out of town, I wanted a discount. Stay somewhere else!!!!!!
