Text: This motel is very cute, CLEAN, and well maintained.  The rooms are generous in size and they have a nice size mini-fridge with a freezer!  There is a small outside seating area on each of the 2 floors.  I would stay here again.

Text: Owner not accommodating at all. Was looking for any reason to charge us extra for the room because he didn't want 4 people in a room even though it was a double bed setup.
