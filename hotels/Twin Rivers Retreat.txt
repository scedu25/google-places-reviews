Twin Rivers Retreat
Rating: 3
Text: We were really excited to camp here with our 7 year old niece because of all of the activities that are listed on the website (canoes, paddle boats, climbing wall, archery, etc). We waited around for the management on Saturday morning to find out about the activities, but they never showed up.  We asked the "host" and she said that the activities are only available for holiday weekends and large groups.  We were really disappointed, as were other campers that had specifically spoken to the management about doing the activities on that weekend.  We wished we had stayed at Kankakee State Park, which had much nicer scenery and hiking trails and was also cheaper.
