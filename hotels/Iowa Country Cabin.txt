Iowa Country Cabin
Rating: 5
Text: We've stayed at this Clarinda bed and breakfast several times when we've visited the southwest Iowa area for the Glen Miller Festival, when we're visiting family and when we just needed a get-away.  The beds are comfortable and clean, and Denise makes a great breakfast.  We loved hiking on their trail and just sitting on the porch to watch the sunrise.  I'd recommend this place.
