Text: Nice place. Check in is 3. Best part check out is noon! Happy not to be rushed. 
The only bad comment is about booking. When I was done paying online, I was told I had to print off the confirmation page. On the bottom it said this hotel does not accept confirmation from a mobile device. 
Came to check in, she didn't even need the paper. I guess the website needs updated.

Text: Stayed for one quick night. Breakfast last till 10. Nothing that great. But it's free. boiled eggs, waffle maker, toast, bagels, pastry, coffee, Apple juice (Not that good), and orange juice. Rooms were clean. Indoor pool. No outdoor pool. Directly across from the Kentucky speedway which is quite convenient if you are attending. Beds were decent. Water softener is very very strong.

Text: I didn't realize this hotel was directly across the street from the Kentucky Speedway. Being a big NASCAR fan that was awesome. The hotel staff was friendly. The rooms were very clean. The rate was very reasonable too. I definitely would stay there again.

Text: Was in town for an event at the speedway, its across the street my room had a view of the speedway. Room was clean, bed was nice. AC work perfectly and the shower had hot water. I will be staying there again next time I need to be at the speedway I had the 1 king and pull out couch, the room basically had two rooms, one for the couch and one for the bed, TV in each section with a good size wall to split each section.
