Historic Boone Tavern Hotel and Restaurant
Rating: 5
Text: An unexpected find on a drive through Kentucky. The Tavern is beautiful, filled with history, warm polished wood and authentic pieces of art. The food was amazing. Huge portions, great flavors and stellar service. We'll absolutely be back!

Text: Friendly staff, nice rooms, very comfy place. Had breakfast at the restaurant with the vouchers and it was well worth it! I like that it is a green/efficient hotel while still being nicer than most. Only things I didn't like are the fridge has no adjustment to be turned down so it doesn't freeze things, as well as the lack of clothes iron and board. I was hoping it would have one. Overall, still a very pleasant stay while visiting Berea.

Text: A very impressive historic hotel. The rooms were quaint, lovely, clean, and well maintained. The front desk and restaurant staff were friendly and welcoming. I only had breakfast at the restaurant, but I had breakfast two mornings of my two night stay because the restaurant was that good.

Text: As the name tells you, an historic hotel.  It has all of the amenities, though.  The room I got is small by today's standards, but was perfect for my needs.  The staff is friendly and the decor tasteful.  The restaurant in the hotel is excellent.   Again, tastefully done with an excellent staff and superb menu.
