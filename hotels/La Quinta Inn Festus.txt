Text: I am very picky about where I stay and I really liked this hotel. The staff were so very nice and helpful. For all of the amenities, the price was very reasonable. It had free WiFi, Flat Screen tv, microwave, refrigerator, an air conditioner that worked, nice pool, great breakfast and dinner, and the other patrons who stayed at the hotel were friendly and appeared to be middle to upper class. It was very clean and quiet and you cannot hear any of the other guests when you are in your room. I felt very safe there. There are also multiple places to eat within walking distance from the hotel, and a grocery store. The only complaint I would have is that the beds are a little firmer than I am used to. I will be back there to stay again very soon........Susie

Text: A little on the expensive side for a king/non smoking room. The walls were kind of thin, I could hear the bathroom next door being used. Breakfast was mediocre. Bread was stale, doughnuts were from an old box. Is it too much to ask for fresh doughnuts? Access to the room was good. No long walks or stairs. Parking was good and we were able to park close to an entrance.

Text: I stayed at the Drury in Festus for one night on business. I would have to stay that the staff was very pleasant and accomodating (even though I arrived to check in around midnight) and the room was not only clean, but very comfortable! I am normally squeemish in hotels because I don't enjoy the thought of being the 200th person to stay in a room, but everything smelled and looked amazingly clean, and the updated furnishings and bedding was quite comfortable and cozy. Continental breakfast available as well, which is a major plus on business trips! You definitely get what you pay for at this Drury.
