Text: Nice hotel with breakfast you can eat there or grab a to go bag. Has a couple good restaurants right in front of the hotel. Real close to the highway so you are only a few minutes away from Indy. The price is worth what you get.

Text: Always clean and very nice. They serve drinks at night to all customers. One of the best Hamptons in indy. However the last visit the lady behind the counter was slow and set me up in the wrong room and really just did not know what she was doing.

Text: This is an excellent hotel if your hobbies include studying and collect different types of fungus and bacteria. My room had black mold growing on the corner of the wall and ceiling, and a yellow film growing in the tub. But no worries the woman and the front desk offered me a whopping $10 a night off my room for subjecting me and my family to health issues. So thoughtful!  Even though she had the customer service personality of a redfish left in the sun for weeks, she eventually agreed to comp my room. Ten minutes later I received a full bill!!! It's a great thing I'm a Hilton Honors member, because at this branch, that doesn't seem to matter at all!!
