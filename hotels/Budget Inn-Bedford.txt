Budget Inn-Bedford
Rating: 4
Text: This is a decent place.  It's an old time roadside motel.  Nothing fancy but it serves its purpose.  The owners are kind and thoughtful, being very nice to us.  The beds we thought at first didn't seem like they were going to work well but we slept real good each night we were there.  If we ever come back to this area,  we'd definitely stay there again.   I'd highly recommend it to anyone.

Text: I am a computer technician ,If you don't want to spend $100 at the other motels , Budget Inn will make a nice quiet place to sleep, as an old truck driver  I can definitely tell you , and assure you, there is room for two semis trucks, plenty of room to turn around ,I spoke to the owner mr. Taylor , he dose a good job of keeping the place , it is a quiet, friendly, place, very affordable,  under $45 it does not have a lot of Thrills and Frills, it is a Budget Motel, no bugs, we checked, a very clean bathroom,  you will find the basics soaps satellite TV clean towels and bedding ,beds were clean and nice, comfortable, no bugs, it is an older place, but if you need to get off the road it's nice and quiet, I will stay here again next time I'm in town. like I said it is an older Motel,

Text: I have stayed at this motel several times even for weeks at a time.  Went there today to rent a room for the night and there was a new guy there saying they raised the prices to $51 a night??  No notice or anything?!?  Every time I have stayed it has been $45 and all of a sudden a jump in price with no notice on the door or anything!
