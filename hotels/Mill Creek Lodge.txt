Mill Creek Lodge
Rating: 5
Text: When we first booked Mill Creek Lodge for our wedding, the venue was just opening for business and they were still working on finishing some of the finer details. Over the next year, Kris (manager) promised several things would be completed and in place for our wedding a year later. Kris and Vern (owner) held their promise! They were both extremely accommodating with our special requests and made sure that what we requested was done to the best of their ability. 

The venue is absolutely gorgeous. Set in the middle of the Flint Hills, it would be hard to find a more scenic venue around the Manhattan area. The old, rustic farm house, barn, and beautifully landscaped area allows for endless picture opportunities. 

The only downside I could comment on is the location. The venue is located about 8 miles west of Alma and 9 miles east of Alta Vista with no easy direct route from I-70. Several of our guests commented about Google/Apple maps taking them down a 2-track road through a pasture when coming from the west. Luckily, the roads were dry and everyone made it to the venue. There is no cell service at the venue, which was honestly great! During the reception, nobody was sitting at the tables on their phone. Instead, they were out on the dance floor having a great time!

Text: I worked a wedding out here and was so happy with how easy it was to get around the property and enjoy the natural beauty of Kansas. My only complaint was the horrible cell service which isn't their fault. Will be recommending to friends looking into venues closer to Manhattan!
