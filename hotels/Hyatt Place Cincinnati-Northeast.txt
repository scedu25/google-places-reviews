Text: Room was awesome!  super clean, and very large with 2 queens and a sleeper sofa.  Beds & bed linens extremely comfy.  air-conditioner worked well and I didn't hear any noise from other rooms or from street.  Pool was older but  clean and adequate for me and my family.  Staff friendly and breakfast had lots to choose from.  I would definitely stay here again

Text: Location is great! We spent several days in the area. Room was nice. Would've been nice to have a microwave in room and bathroom could've been bigger but room was nice and clean. Breakfast was the best we've had! Pool was very disappointing as we wanted it for the kids after long days to relax. It was dirty, outdated and needs a major facelift. Rest of hotel was updated and nice.

Text: Staying Thursday to Sunday. Clean hotel and nice room layout (king bed with sleeper sofa). On third floor and there were some ants in the bathroom. Bathroom has shower only, no tub. Main lobby layout is weird. Breakfast plates and cups are up high and not kid accessible. Overall pleased with stay.
