Text: Great place to stay! Was clean and had everything you could possibly need. When ever we travel back to Wichita we will always have a nice home away from home!?

Text: Really nice hotel. Employees were really nice . The bed was very comfortable.  Asked for ground floor and got it. Fair location kinda off the main road which made it quite.  It will stay here every time I am in Wichita.
