Drury Inn & Suites Springfield
Rating: 5
Text: This is a great place to stay, especially when traveling with children.  We had our 2 grandchildren with us.  The 5:30 to 7:00 dinner and adult beverages (3 per adult every day, not just weekdays) all included along with breakfast was much appreciated and actually better than expected. It is still hotel food but the variety made it good. Kid friendly food also. 
Room was very clean, comfortable beds, clean hotel overall. 
Staff was excellent and very friendly. 
I will look to stay here and at other Drury Inn properties when traveling.

Text: I have stayed at a lot of Drury Inns and this one was the worst I have ever been to. The rooms were good but the food was horrible. I have never been to a Drury that did not have chicken on the bar for 5 pm kickbacks. The only meat they had was hot dogs, if that even counts as a meat. The cheese for nachos was so extremely watered down you couldn't taste the cheese. The salad bar consisted of lettuce, cheese and ranch dressing, if you didn't like ranch, or wanted eggs or croutons,  you were just out of luck. The popcorn was stale. Then the potatoes at breakfast tasted like they had been cooked the night before and they were completely out of milk by 7:15.  It was the absolute worst experience I have had at a Drury. Good thing most are ALOT better! We won't pay extra to stay at this Drury again!!!

Text: Always will stay at a drury inn. Never have had a bad experience. The hotel is clean, quiet, comfortable beds, and the kickback part is awesome. Great food and great drinks!

Text: Although it's a bit pricey, its more than worth it. Very modern and clean, rooms are spacious and the bathroom is split so the toilet and shower are in a separate room. You'll find a microwave and small fridge in the room, more importantly you'll have 30+ channels to choose from on the TV. The pool is inside-outside and there is a small hot tub. The hotel also offers free soft drinks and popcorn daily as well as an evening reception offering free hot food and cold beverages. Breakfast offers eggs, sausage, potatoes, and biscuit and gravy, and waffles. Along with the standard toast, cereal, oatmeal, and donuts. This is the place to stay, restaurants and fast food are close by, with Ruby Tuesday next door.
