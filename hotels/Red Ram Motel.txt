Text: I used to live nearby and booked a room here while my plumbing at home was being repaired. I only used the bathroom so I can't comment on the other furnishings. But the pictures speak for themselves. There's a rag over the shower head in one picture because it sprayed in so many different directions.

Text: Older motel but Very Clean and reasonable rates. Stayed for 4 nights and it was very quiet whole time. Very quiet location. had a large truck parking for my trailer. Fridge and microwave was very handy for my extended stay. If you are picky and used to stay at Holiday inn or Hampton then stay away! I Will recommend to anyone who is on tight budget and need clean place to stay.
