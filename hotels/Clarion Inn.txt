Text: We were a little skeptic at first...don't be! This is a super clean hotel with great service! Liz and Bryan were super nice! The breakfast was amazing! Not your regular (Holiday Inn, La Quinta...etc) out of a bag into the microwave breakfast. They had meat,(thick bacon, not thin and microwaved) eggs, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, pastries... The pool is simple and has a cute slide located in the somewhat center of the hotel. The pool could be right out your back door if you choose. The price is very reasonable! The restaurant definitely gets ***** as well! Hat's off to the chef! The only thing I could say that was a little inconvenient was the smaller bathrooms, but it doesn't stop us from coming back!! Great Job Clarion Inn owner/staff keep up the good work and lower prices!
