Holiday Inn Express & Suites Pratt
Rating: 4
Text: The Holiday Inn Express Pratt has many of the amenities you would expect from the hotel chain. The rooms were relatively modern with comfortable beds, a fridge, and a microwave. Service was incredibly friendly, though they were out of toothpaste at the front desk - my fault for forgetting to pack some in the first place. Thankfully the hotel is located very close to a store, and not far from many of Pratt's restaurants. The morning breakfast was nice and had many options, including a delightful machine where you push a button and it makes two fresh pancakes right then and there. The only warning I'd have for future guests is to beware some of the rooms located between 200-220, though I'm not sure exactly which rooms. Our room was humid and smelled strongly of chlorine, as it was located directly above the indoor pool area on the ground floor. Something to keep in mind is all. Should I find myself in Pratt again I would very likely come back.

Text: The best hotel I have stayed at in years. Amazing service. Great rooms. Good breakfast. The only downside is the elevator is a little slow. But still, I would not stay at any other place in town.

Text: Nice hotel for a small town in Kansas in the middle of nowhere. The front desk staff was friendly when I checked in. Room is nice. Also they have sweet tea by the front desk all day long. It's usually pretty good.

Text: Very friendly staff! Rooms are a bit older compared to other Holiday Inn Express's. Overall a solid choice.

Text: It was a quiet and rested night. The rooms were very clean and the facilities just have everything you need for a night to rest before hitting the road again. Just loved it!!!
I'm an IHG member, and they took care of everything. Thank you!
