Text: We love staying at Norma's Nook! It's a charming home with comfy beds, delightful vintage decor, a fine little kitchen, and inviting dining and living room spaces. We've rented it several times on our weekends to Crete and have wonderful memories - the morning sunlight filtering though the ivory sheers on the windows, a pot of my homemade minestrone simmering on the Amana range, conversation and laughter around the dining room table, and family photos on the front porch. Thank you to innkeepers Larry and Teri - we are already looking forward to our next visit to Norma's.
