Text: It was my first day to visit this hotel. It is a good economical place. They have good staff. Danielle is the most wonderful front desk lady who will meet you with a big awesome welcome smile as you walk in. Very loving and she will explain everything to you in details while trying to cheer you up. 
I will be a regular guest whenever I  within that area.

Text: The non-smoking room smells like smoke. I just saw a cockroach walking across the armoire that holds the t.v. and microwave and the lady at the front desk refuses to let me move rooms or give me a refund! The room is dirty. They lady came down to my room to try to catch the cockroach!!! That's all she could offer me?! I moved the armoire where the cockroach went and it's filthy behind there! My key has locked me out 5 times and the attendant acts as if it's my fault! What kind of place are they running? There is no customer service...how would you feel if there was a cockroach in your room?!?! There are sketchy people who look like they may be on drugs in the halls. WARNING: Do not stay here!!
