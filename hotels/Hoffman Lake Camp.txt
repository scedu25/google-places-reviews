Text: We love this campground. It's secluded, quiet and peaceful. It's close to Warsaw if you need something you forgot. This campground offers a lot of nice amenities. They have a pool, splash pad, lake with beach access, playground, recreational room with arcade games, boat rentals, fishing, cabin rentals and much more. The staff is accommodating. Clean bathrooms!!!! If you're thinking about camping here I suggest you do!!

Text: When I arrived I was welcomed with smiles, and given a tour of the area. The campgrounds were very well kept. The cabins overlooking the lake have a great morning view, for sitting and drinking coffee. There is a pool for those of us that don't like to swim in the lake... and a play area for the kids. Activities for the whole family! Highly recommend!!!

Text: Wonderful local campground! Facilities are clean and spacious. They have a nice pool and slash pad. Basketball and other activities are available.  If you follow the rules you won't have an issue with the staff. They have rules for a reason. They have always been kind and caring to my family. We will return and recommend to our friends and family.

Text: Love this place!  Use to be my family old campgrounds over 45 years ago.  We were there, almost when Mr. & Mrs. Long first started this amazing campground!  I treasure those memories, and will always continue going back and making new memories.  Beautiful pool, lakefront cabins, boating and fishing.  There's even a beach to swim in the lake!  I couldn't ask for more!  ?
