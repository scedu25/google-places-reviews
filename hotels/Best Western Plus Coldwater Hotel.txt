Best Western Plus Coldwater Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Our stay was so great. We needed a nice short getaway and I won't forget when going away again how well we were treated. 
The young lady at the front desk was so nice upon reception and when we left. You couldn't have had a much better employee to greet guests.
One of the maids on the 3rd floor (315) went out of her way to get me a dolly to use for our leave. She was very nice and helpful.
The pool and spa were an excellent addition and luckily we had it alone as I am handicapped and sometimes feel embarrassed. Thank You !!!

Text: Room was spotless and spacious. Perfect for my family. Pool was similarly clean and spa was much enjoyed and relaxing. The only down side to the hotel is the tiny sign on the roadway; the hotel is very easy to drive by.
