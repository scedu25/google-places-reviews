Text: Awesome place. On our first visit, we were laterally level from the get-go. Our second visit, we only needed an inch worth of rise on one side. Bathrooms are clean, staff is super friendly. Plenty of space for our dogs. Pull through spots are super easy to get in & out of. We'll definitely be visiting here again whenever we're in town.

Text: Fit our needs perfectly! Clean, welcoming RV park, right  off the freeway. Perfect for a weary traveler, sites are long enough to keep your toad hooked up. Small store, social room, workout room. Spotless, secure bathrooms. Whole place is decorated, very nice, FHU, pick Nick areas in grass/ treed spot.

Text: All gravel. Level drive through spaces. Not too tight. Easy access from road. Near a few fast food places and gas station. Playground and Sandbox was a great addition. Got in early enough for my daughter to enjoy it and hung around in the am for her enjoyment as well. Did not notice any road noise or anything even though we could see the highway. Would definitely park here a night or two again if traveling through.

Text: We stopped for a night traveling through. Nice long p/t sites so we didn't have to unhook. Staff is friendly, grounds are clean and well kept. Dog friendly. We didn't use any facilities.

Text: Friendly folks at check and we could see the owners are making improvements. I would have given them five stars, but when the park is full you will be facing your neighbors front door - so only three stars. We stopped here because they support the Military, Police and Firemen, and I support business that do. The place is great for an overnight stay, but for longer I wouldn't stay here again.
