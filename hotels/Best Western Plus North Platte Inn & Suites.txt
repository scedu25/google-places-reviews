Text: Excellent. I came in at 2:30 am exhausted, looking for a room and the front desk staff was super friendly and helpful this late at night. They gave me a great deal on a room that allowed my pooch and got me situated quickly and efficiently. Room was very spacious and clean. Comfy and clean bed. Wonderful shower with plenty of clean towels in room. 24 hr pool and hot tub! I was too tired to use it but it looked nice. And now I see on the other reviews that I missed happy hour! I must return to this hotel! I will be back. Highly recommend.
