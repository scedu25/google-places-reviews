Kanawha State Forest

Text: Relaxing to just sit and enjoy. Walking trails. Bike trail. Lovely shelters. Relaxing water sounds. Shade or sun -- I could pick. Rustic camp site at $24 seems a bit steep.

Text: Bike trails need to be better rated. We tried the only trail rated as easy, but it was far from easy. We didn't even make it a quarter of a mile before turning back.

Text: I've always loved KSF, it's great for mountain biking, hiking and picnics. My family is going there to camp soon, I'm sure it will be a great time also.

Text: I absolutely love Kanawha State Forest. My favorite spot is the fire pit behind the old pool area. There are multiple creeks running along the sides. A nice trail past the fire pit that leads further up and back into the mountains. While a lot of WV is dying from all the stream and air pollution, Kanawha State Forest still has good energy and stays kind of vibrant compared to the surrounding areas in WV. Coal and other pollution has destroyed so much of the vibrant colors we used to have in our mountains. It is good to escape to a place that isn't that badly affected.
