Text: I came her a wedding reception. It was cozy. My friend who got married, left their cake topper there and no one contacted her to let her know if they had it. We believe it was thrown away. :-(

Text: Staff has gotten better but they won't work with you if you need more time to pay. The lot rent is the highest in this area.

Text: If you are visiting make sure you map this area out before you arrive because they removed  all of the street signs at 35th street. My friend had an emergency plumbing issue and I  I had to drive all over the place just to find the street that I was looking for. The street signs were there in 2012. Thumbs down on this place.
