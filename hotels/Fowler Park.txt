Text: My dad took my son camping here for the night and when I came to pick him up they would not let me in. I had a pass, but not a camping slip. They informed me that only campers were allowed back and even though my son was back there, I could leave the park to go to their $5 parking. Cross a street with traffic, and walk all the way into the park and all the way to where they were camping while carrying my 7 month old daughter, and walk all the way back out of the park, crossing a busy street, with my 7 month old daughter and 2  year old son... Because that's safe. 
I will never bring my kids here again, that is absolutely ridiculous. 
(I had to call my dad and have him bring me my son without a carseat in his car, and wait a good 25 minutes in their $5 parking ?)

Text: The park guy Clint made my experience at the park unforgettable.  Always helpful and knowledgeable. If you need to host a gathering the Barn can accommodate all types of gatherings.
