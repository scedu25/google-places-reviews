Text: My online reservation for some reason had been messed up.  Jeska at the front desk went beyond the Call of Duty to make it right. Not only was the service incredible at the front desk, but it is an amazing new, fresh, very clean and awesome accommodations.
You can't go wrong staying here. I will definitely stay there again next time I'm in that area. Thank you Jeska for caring. Being pet friendly was a big plus as well.

Text: Clean hotel, friendly staff, pet friendly so expect a few dogs. Free breakfast was surprisingly well laid out with quite a few options. Rooms are modern, clean, and well equipped to include a microwave, mini fridge, and hair dryer. Parking lot is well lit and there is ample space for your pet to run around and do their business.
