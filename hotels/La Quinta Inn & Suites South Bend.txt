Text: The night desk person was very nice. Comfy beds, clean place, good assortment for breakfast. They allow pets! However you can not change your room temp, set on 70... We just wanted it down to 68... Medically study for the ideal sleep temp and for the moving air... At home we sleep with the ceiling fan on low. Also tried to shower!!! Augh... Water would only come out as hot as soon as you would add cold it would trickle out and the shower head would shut off. So I spent 30 minutes trying to wash my hair, thick curly hair. Not enough water coming out to make sure it was rinsed.

Text: We stayed one night with our 2 dogs.  The room was spotless and next to an exit door.  They went out of their way to accommodate our needs.  Full breakfast.   Would definitely stay again.  Thank you.

Text: I usually don't post a bad review, but this place deserves it. The room was just okay. I was charged at a rate that was higher than AAA rate. The manager would NOT make this right. I will NOT  be going back to this Inn.
