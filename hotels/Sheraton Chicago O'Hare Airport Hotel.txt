Sheraton Chicago O'Hare Airport Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: Hotel is convenient to airport and the airport shuttle is very efficient, not to mention no cost. It's a little dated but rooms are very big. Bed was too firm and the pillows too soft for me but if that's your thing stay here for sure. It was overall a good stay with friendly staff and I'd recommend if you're looking for a hotel convenient to O'Hare.

Text: Went for a company event that was located in a first floor conference room. Atmosphere was nice, but an electrical issue caused the lights to flicker when they were dimmed. Attentive wait staff and good food, but dishes could have been cleaner. Found a couple of glasses with food particles stuck in them. Impressive dining/lounge area in the center of the building. Did not stay in a room, so I can't comment on that.

Text: Decent hotel. Rooms were decent - had a suite that was large, but somewhat outdated. VERY GOOD food and courteous staff.

Text: Very nice hotel close to the Airport. Excellent service and high quality of the rooms. The shower was a bit dated and there wasn't a big flow of water. Overall good experience for a short and even mid term stay.

Text: Got a voucher from United airlines due to a missed connection. Shuttle runs every 20mins after midnight. Shuttle takes ~10 minutes depending on how many other guests they need to pick up. Check in with the United voucher was easy. The voucher was for ~$110 The building is quite dated and a few of the atrium lights were out. The rooms were very spacious and clean. However, it's 2017... and wifi isn't free at the hotel. If I were paying ~110 for the room I would expect free WiFi, and a bit comfier.
