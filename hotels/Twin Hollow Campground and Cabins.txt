Twin Hollow Campground and Cabins

Text: Great place to camp and use the Hatfield and McCoys trail system. Donna and Cameron will take good care of you. We rented a side by side for our wives to drive, it ran great the girls had a great time. Also they have a great barbecue place you need to get a trail 12 hot dog. I've been thinking about it ever since.

Text: This was my 3rd trip up and it will not be my last. The place is great! I like it so much that I invited some friends up. 3 RV sites and 2 cabins worth of income. However, my enjoyment was overshadowed by my embarrassment when  Ms Donna made a huge issue out of us gathering at one of the cabins to talk about the day and have some food. She questioned why more than 4 folks were there and that for us to "BE SURE" we had no more than 4 in the cabin (or on the deck or any where else around the cabin) at any time.  Not one cabin or RV site had more people on them than the rules allow once we ended our day. With that said, I will be back but in very small numbers. Still, the place is super nice but not for group gatherings. Also, if you haven't been in a while, the driveway is now paved.  :)

Text: What an awesome campground! Everyone here is so friendly and nice! Love that it is family run. We had campsite #12 and it was the best on the lot! Clean bathhouses and they bring water in. Trail 12 BBQ was absolutely delicious. Short ride to town. Can't wait to go back!

Text: Cameron took a group of us on a sunset tour of the trails.  We had a blast stopping to feed wild horses on one of the mountain tops.  The views were spectacular! Since it was a last minute decision and all the cabins were booked, he was able to hook us up with a great inn, just down the street.
