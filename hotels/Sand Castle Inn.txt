Text: The pool room was very nice, everything their website claimed it would be. The hostess was eager to make sure we had anything we needed. The refreshment area was stocked throughout the evening for coffee, iced tea and some outstanding lemonade. Breakfast was headlined by a very tasty egg and asparagus cassarole dish as well as biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, and a variety of baked goods. Very pleasant stay to celebrate my anniversary.

Text: Excellent experience! The staff was extremely friendly, the room was very clean and had a homey feeling, and the home cooked breakfast was well above expectation. Best part, this place is only a block from the beach. Would recommend this B&B to anyone looking for a nice stay in South Haven.

Text: We were in the Tower room which was large and nicely decorated. The problem was the king sized bed. It is time for the owners to buy a new mattress. The bed was so very soft!

Text: Great location can walk to town or the lake. Very nice facility and service is wonderful, but wish breakfast was available a little earlier in the morning.

Text: Our room was great amd the food was good. Our host's were very kind but not overbearing. We stayed for 4 days and loved every minute of it.
