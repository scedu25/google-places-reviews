Charleston Plaza Hotel
Rating: 3
Text: The location of this hotel is perfect for getting anywhere downtown quickly. The interior could use an update, but was clean and free of odors. There was no complimentary breakfast, only coffee (big disappointment). They allow pets, which is nice. They are currently undergoing a transition, so that's why some things were just not right. The staff was the best part of my stay here. The friendliest and helpful bunch I've ever met!

Text: The quality of stay wasn't worth the price. No clear sign of the hotel was available at night time. The parking lot and lobby is sketchy. The room was a small improvement but one bed didn't even have a comforter. Only a sheet was on the bed. Room service nor the front desk brought us one. The toilet we thought was gonna break. Will not be returning.

Text: Me and my husband stayed here for the Alan Jackson concert we smelled weed in the elevator the tv only picked up local channels, no shampoo in the bathroom toilet didn't flush right and teenagers running in the hallway half the night and we had to go to another floor to get ice ! Would never stay here again , we didn't even feel safe .But I will say the staff was friendly !

Text: Good hotel, very close to Historic Downtown, nice and clean, the staff is helpful and attentive. Pool is working. No microwave in the room, but there's one in the lobby that you can use.

Text: Where to be a cheap motel is actually quite nice better than some of the hundred dollar hotels in town the staff goes above and beyond for everyone and it's actually clean
