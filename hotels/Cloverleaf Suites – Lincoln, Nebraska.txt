Cloverleaf Suites – Lincoln, Nebraska
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms are just like they're pictured online. It's like a mini apartment. The room had a full sized fridge, stove, microwave and included basic cooking utensils - plates, knives, pans, etc. The price was right. Hopefully, it will still be modestly priced after renovations are completed. They offered complimentary shuttle service anywhere in Lincoln. Staff were extremely helpful and positive. I'm a hard person to impress, but if they can repeat this weekend, this is where I will stay when I'm in Lincoln. Staff were great about keeping the breakfast fully stocked until after 10 am. There is some noise from the other rooms, but the positives completely outweighed the negatives. Maintenance staff will were quick to respond when we spoke with the front desk.

Text: Spacious and clean rooms with a comfortable bed. Breakfast options have improved with the new management, including good coffee. Friendly staff. Rooms have a fireplace, which would be really nice if you're staying for a while.

Text: We wouldn't stay here again. Heat was set at 50°, it took a long time to warm up. Had a musty smell and wasn't clean. There was noticeable dust build up in many places. We expected so much more for $189/night!

Text: Despite being a large, sprawling network of individual buildings, it's easy to navigate and find where you need to go. The rooms were immaculate and the staff was very helpful/friendly
