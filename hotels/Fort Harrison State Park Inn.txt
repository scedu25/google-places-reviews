Text: We had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding in the Roosevelt room at the end. The staff was helpful in the days leading up to the event as well as very professional during the event itself. We already loved coming two Sunday brunch at the inn and are very glad we held our dinner there.

Text: Really nice, spacious rooms. People were so nice and welcoming. Breakfast was decent, not very many options. Room and sheets were clean. However, the jetted tub didnt work or the jets in the shower. We were bummed out about that. But I will definitely stay again and also recommend to family and friends.

Text: This cozy, well-kept inn is located just outside Ft. Harrison State Park. The inn is like a small version of a national state park lodge. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and in the best way, rustic. Just around the corner, Ft. Harrison State Park offers biking and walking trails. In walking distance are several good restaurants.
