McGreer Camper Park

Text: Very friendly.  Since we were arriving late they had us call when we were getting off the highway and were waiting in the office for us when we got there.  They must have just cut or baled hay, because the smell of fresh cut hay greeted us when we got out of the truck, one of my favorite smells.  Camp ground is small as it is on a working farm, looked to be in there side yard, all level grassy lots, nice bathrooms and showers( even has disposable mats to stand on to get dressed).  Washer and dryer also.

Text: Easy-Off easy-on from I-80. Owner/manager was very friendly. Two large truck stops on the same exit. Sites where desert sand but surprisingly level. I would stay here again if I was traveling past.

Text: What a wonderful place!! Although this Campground is a small campground it is on a 10,000 acre working corn/soy bean/wheat farm!! Tim McGreer checked us in. Then proceeded to answer all my questions about the corn farming industry in general and his farm in particular. We walked a portion of the farm with him as he explained the working of the farm. He then gave us permission to feel free to walk around!!  We did!!!  Full hook-up, washer ($1.25) dryer (25¢ for 15 minutes - threw 75¢ in and was more than dry). Thank you McGreer family for a memorable experience.

Text: Easy to get to, loved it. Showers were amazing and very clean. Having been driving for a long time it was a God's send to be in the middle of no where. Lexie was very understanding on our late arrival. The sites were level since we have a pop up camper and needs to be leveled most of the time. Thanks, for the camping experience and your service in the military. Don't think I didn't notice his medals. Thank you.
