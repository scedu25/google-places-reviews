Text: This is a horrible place.. We felt like we were picked on. If the grass wasn't cut down to the dirt they would charge to cut... Even after we had just cut it. And they kick you out with out giving notice... I hated that place. Don't move there unless you want problems...

Text: The place is a joke. Management is always temporary. They nit pick all the time to the tenents but do as they please, shut off the water without notice. Ive got 6 cops in front of my house while the drunken neighbors fist fight in the streets and a police chase and a car jacking, but I get my truck towed for parking in a spot that belongs to know one! I got my money back on that but its unnessasary BS, all the time.
Too much too even type in. The management is temporary but its not clear who is the next level. 
Look elsewhere ! 
Ive been here 9 years and I am trying to get out now.

Text: Too many hidden fees and fines, no good park to bring kids to, you pay lot rent but have to take care of your lot completely and will get fined if not to their expectations. Can't have garage or yard sales, have to ask permission when adding / removing gardens, water gets shut off without warning for maintenance frequently, ect ect ect. But there are basket ball hoops.. and an old rusty slide and broken swings!!
