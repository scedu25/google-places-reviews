Text: A real hidden gem. Updated toilets and televisions. Older furniture but clean and comfortable with windows that open. Fast, free wifi. Run by a wonderfully friendly and accommodating family. Will go back again if I have the opportunity.

Text: This is a very clean and neat hotel run by a super-nice family. The rooms are comparable to any chain hotel, and the price can't be beat. If you're staying in Monitcello choose to support this family-owned hotel. You won't be disappointed.
