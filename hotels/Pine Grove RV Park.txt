Text: They have sites with water and electric hook ups or tent camping if that is your thing. I think the dump station works but I didn't have need to use it.  The pool is well cared for and at times they bring out a bouncy house.  There is a playground as well if you need to have the kids go entertain themselves for a bit.  The staff works hard to keep everything nice.  I will keep going back.

Text: We planned a day at the zoo with our great granddaughter and wanted a campground somewhat close by that had a playground.  The campground is VERY well maintained, bathrooms are clean.  Wifi is NOT good and will only allow 1 device.  So if wifi is important to you, take a hotspot with you.  The playground is VERY nice with a few new things added.  The not so  good thing about the playground is that it is on the main road that leads to the campground before you get to the office.  The only way to get to it is a VERY long walk on the main road leading in.  Just feels unsafe and you would NEVER allow your child to go alone. There is no where to park a vehicle if you would choose to drive to it.  The person working the desk was very nice, the owner not so much.  I tried to compliment her on honoring the military, she never made eye contact and walked away as I was talking to her.  Kind of makes you feel like a second rate citizen at best.  There is highway noise since it is close to I-80 but that was not a big deal to us.  I would like to give it a 5 just on the appearance of the campground, but still feel like our business was not really welcome.  We have stayed at the KOA in Gretna a couple of times, but they were full this time.  This IS a nicer campground but will stay in Gretna the next time, we have always been welcomed at the KOA.  I asked when we first arrived where the nearest grocery was.  Told in Greenwood at a store called "no frills".  Told me the map of the campground had a $5.00 off coupon if you spent $30.00.  Well I spent $75.00 and they could not honor the coupon as it expired in Sept.  I mentioned this to the desk person as I was finally able to do the paperwork (office is closed most of the time).  The owner heard what I was saying about the coupon (as my husband had come to the office to express problems with the wifi) the owner did tell the person at the desk to give us one additional wifi code.  Neither worked so we had to contact our hotspot to have it turned on.  A beautiful campground that could be an A+ if they would put more into customer "friendly" service.

Text: Clean, level sites. No frills, but very relaxing. Owner was very nice and helpful. Will stay here if we are in the area again. OBTW they only accept cash and do not take reservations, so come prepared.
