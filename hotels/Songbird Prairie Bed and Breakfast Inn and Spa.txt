Text: My husband and I have had the best time here this weekend! The room is gorgeous and incredibly relaxing. The scenery and ambiance is so beautiful, especially with all the Fall colors. Most importantly though, the breakfast, made and served by our wonderful host and hostess, is phenomenal!! To top it all off, we were treated to a wonderful display of sweet little birds and squirrels dancing around the trees as we enjoyed our morning meal! Thank you so much for everything; we can’t wait to come back!

Text: We had such a delightful time at Songbird Prairie! The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing, and we felt very well taken care of. The little surprise treats in the room were fun to find! The best part is the breakfast - it is an experience by itself. Getting to listen to and watch the birds, while dining on a beautiful and delectable breakfast is a great memory for us. I would return even for that alone! This is a place my husband and I would love to experience every season! We have been telling family and friends about it, so they can know about the wonderful opportunity, as well. ?

Text: we were greeted upon arrival and taken to our suite, shown how everything works and all information needed for stay.  our time there was limited because we were busy most of the trip. the time we did spend there was amazing.  last morning breakfast was brought to our room and this was the best breakfast i have ever eaten.  owners were very gracious and accommodating.  the room and surrounding property were all absolutely beautiful.  this is the best place i have ever stayed and would highly recommend anyone in the area stay there.

Text: We have stayed in numerous B&B's across the country. In fact, whenever we travel, my husband and I only stay in B&B's. So, I spend a considerable amount of time researching each place, reading all the reviews etc. before we even book. Consequently, we have had great experiences in all of them. But, the Songbird Prairie Bed & Breakfast was a cut above the rest. Not only were the accommodations clean, comfortable and inviting, but their attention to detail was over the top. This home was specifically built as a B&B so each room has a gas fireplace and spa-like tub--ours was large enough for two! Even though my husband is not a bath person, it was our anniversary, so he obliged. Even he could not have been more relaxed and pampered. In addition to providing bath salts and an oil candle, there were comfortable robes and slippers in the armoire. The room was also equipped with a sound machine with six different options from which to choose--ocean waves, rain, tropical forest, waterfall, heartbeat, and the like. Other amenities such as a pitcher of water and beautiful glassware were in the room along with truffles under miniature domed china, make-up remover towelettes, luxurious towels and bed linens, deliciously scented soap and lotion, easily accessible remotes, dimmer switches . . . you name it, it was there! 
In addition to the room itself, the grounds were enchanting. Surrounded by over 6 acres, and built amongst the trees, this was truly a private haven. We loved walking the path, relaxing in the hammock, and taking in all the sights and sounds of the birds. With tons of feeders and birdbaths sprinkled throughout the property grounds, and the trees equipped with microphones, the enchanting sounds are breathtaking and can be heard both inside and out.
Which brings me to the breakfast part. OH MY GOODNESS! This is what I would call a DINING EXPERIENCE! From the ambiance of the room to the elegant manner in which the food was plated, there is absolutely no comparison to anything I have ever encountered! I was in awe. I don't think I've ever taken so many photographs of food in my life. And it tasted incredibly good! Everything was wonderful. Imagine watermelon cut in the shape of birds spilling out of a martini glass plated with fresh flowers and a blueberry scone, accompanied by lemon curd and raspberry jam. And that was just the starter of a three-course meal. I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil all the surprises. 
My review would not be complete, however, without a note about the genuine warmth and kindness of the hosts, Efrain and Barbara. They were delightful people, I would be honored to call friends. Needless to say, if you are ever headed to the Indiana Dunes, or just passing through Valparaiso en route to anywhere, I would definitely spend a night or two at the Songbird Prairie Bed & Breakfast. A gift certificate to someone who could use a nice retreat would be a wonderful Christmas present for a local resident as well! We will most surely return. Thanks Barbara and Efrain for making our anniversary so special.

Text: Your wedding night is meant to be the most romantic night of your life- Songbird Prairie Inn lived up to that expectation. For starters, the Inn and it's location are beautiful. Very secluded and private feeling. Our room was clean and so cozy feeling. From the soft nature sounds they had playing in the room when we arrived down to the little chocolates on our night stands- they pay attention to detail! And WOWZA was breakfast in bed amazing the next morning. The food was so delicious and the presentation was very pretty. The staff was also so so kind! They went above & beyond to make our wedding night and morning after perfect. We will be staying at Songbird Prairie again!
