Text: Nice quiet hotel. Stayed a week for work. Typical breakfast. The only thing I don't like is the water pressure. Very low pressure due to the shower heads. Other than that is was nice.

Text: Check in and all front desk staff was great. They even gave us an upgrade.  Housekeeping and maintenance staff spoke to us coming and going. The breakfast lady however could us another round of hospitality training. Other than that I would stay again. Thanks for everything.

Text: Location just off 55 north of 80 is very convenient. Very clean room, friendly service, and a great (clean) pool and hot tub. Would definitely stay again.

Text: Room was clean. Breakfast was fulfilling. Only issue is we checked in late, ready to put our head down, and found out our air conditioner was shot. Didn't bother calling desk as it was late and was not in the mood to deal with maintenance.

Text: We must have come during a very busy weekend. This is the only place that had a room available. A little more than we wanted to spend but it was nice, clean, and updated.
