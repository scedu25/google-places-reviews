Green River Oaks Camping Resort

Text: Extremely friendly staff.  They were very welcoming and friendly during our entire stay.  I was looking for a needle and thread to buy in the store and they didn't have one. One of the staff members found her own personal needle and thread and brought it to me.  She didn't have to do that. 

The facilities were nice and clean. The kids had the best time playing in the river finding tadpoles,  picking and eating mulberries, and trying to catch fish. One tip is to bring water shoes if you plan to play in the river. There is also a pool and basket ball courts. Our kids enjoyed all of the amenities. We definitely recommend this campground.

Text: Great Camping!!!  2nd year we reserved the group site for our large group and they did not disappoint!  Smooth and quick check-in, firewood delivered right to your site, and very clean and well kept facilities.  We will be back every year - thank you!

Text: We were fine until the second day. The staff got really rude and started yelled at us for no reason. They made a mistake with the paperwork and tried to blame it on us, since they didn't check the facts first. They said we couldn't get our money back for the other day we paid for, but we had to leave. Everntually, after the two owners came twice and tried kicking us out, they realized that we were telling the truth and gave us our money back. They called us a**holes as well, just to top it off. We are never going back there again.
