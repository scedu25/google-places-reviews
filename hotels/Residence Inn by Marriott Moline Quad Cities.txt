Text: Not the best hotel....We have been at this location on a buisness trip for 12 nights. On 2 occasions we had no hot water in the morning. 1 night they did not clean the room but did show up at 6:30 at night to see if we needed anything. The breakfast area was allways out of items and many morning with no hot coffee.  They also serve the same items every morning with no variety. If you know this chain of hotels this is not the way it should be run. Next year when we are back for 2 weeks we will be staying at a different hotel.

Text: Staff was very nice, breakfast was good and always kept full, clean rooms, location was easy to get to normally (a lot of construction around hotel, but not their fault). Only complaint was they came in the middle of the open pool hours to clean it, should maybe have a notice saying it was going to be cleaned or do it overnight when the pool is closed

Text: Our group was able to hang out in the lobby with our own adult beverages, visiting. In the afternoon as everyone drifted in, the put on out football game of choice. The staff got us ice and a bucket when we asked. Very accommodating.

Text: It's fine. Didn't expect a five star hotel but the suite I had felt very cheaply remodeled with low-grade materials and somewhat shoddy work. Basically looked fine from a distance but closer inspection revealed flaws.
