Blue Valley Camping Area
Rating: 4
Text: Not a bad place to stay and relax or temporarily base camp, with you go out and explore Lincoln, for about two or three days. We recommend it. It's Family safe. There is fresh water and RV dump station. The sites only provide (3)50 & (9) 30 amp electric hook-ups. Plenty of room for pets to roam.

Text: Good amount of open space. Gravel parking for trailers and (I guess) tents. $10/night with a two week max stay. Playground and large portable toilet. Only downside-no water hookups, but a spigot is available to fill tanks. Quiet. Dump site.

Text: Nice place to eat a picnic lunch. Children have place to run, the playground is a good size. It's usually quiet here. Love it!

Text: Pulled in here about 8pm on a Sunday and there was plenty of room. $7 tent and $10 camper. Electricity worked and there is a water spigot you can use. Bathroom is a portable. Grounds are nicely mowed and clean. I would stay here again.

Text: Great price ($7 for tent campers) but it's all gravel so a pretty hard camping surface.  Still can't beat the price
