SpringHill Suites by Marriott Cincinnati Midtown
Rating: 4
Text: The SpringHill Suites was a wonderful place to stay for our weekend in Cincinnati. Our room had two queen beds and a pull out couch as well as a separated bathroom (one with a toilet and sink, the other with a sink and shower/tub). The bathrooms were ideal for getting ready for the evening. 
Everything was clean and taken care of. Staff was friendly. Breakfast was yummy. It costs to park but ours was credited, so I'm not sure if they always make you pay. 
There is a very beautiful park, Eden Park, within walking distance of the hotel. We were able to safely explore the area and enjoy this park in the morning.

Text: I was very pleased with the rooms we stayed in. They were large, had nice furniture, and I liked the layout. The couch could be turned into two additional beds which was very convenient. There were two separate rooms for the shower and the toilet. The breakfast area was nice and modern with a decent selection for food. However, I didn't appreciate that you had to pay extra for parking.

Text: Although our stay was quite short (just over night). I have to the staff was quite curtious & accommodating. The rooms were very nice & comfortable. If we're even in Cincinnati again we will definitely return.

Text: The room was very clean and had a very nice set up. I loved the fact that the toilet was separate from the tub/shower. There was a lot of space in the room. The bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was good. The staff was very friendly and courteous. I would MOST definitely stay here again
