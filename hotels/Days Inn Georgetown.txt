Text: Fair warning. Stay away from this place at all cost. I could give y'all a list of what all was wrong with this place. The manager was very rude. There are roaches and trash in the rooms they are not well maintained at all. Cleaning service was not the best. My husband and i Will never stay here again. We killed at least 7 cockroaches and when we told management she got an attitude. She has 0 people skills. In all honesty this place doesn't deserve a star at all. The only good thing was the pilot across the road.

Text: this is one of the most unkempt establishments i have ever stayed the night in: the walls were rotting in spots, the sheets, pillowcases & blankets were covered in all different colors and lengths of hairs, the toilet seat was all scratched up & covered in deep grooves (& there was pubic hair all over the toilet and bathroom floor & tub). The only reason why I gave this 2 stars was because of the quick check in and the grounds behind the hotel and had some beautiful trees, which helped to take away the sick feeling i had when i walked out of the room. i do not recommend staying here unless you have absolutely no other choice.

Text: We arrived late and exhausted and had paid for a jacuzzi suite. The room had been used, bed was unmade and when we returned to the desk they had us check the other suite, which was overwhelming with cigarette smoke, so we requested just a regular non smoking room. Carried all our stuff up to find out it was a smoking room.  The desk clerk offered us some spray. Then after checking out I realized I left my expensive, long USB cord. I called 3 times before someone would check and confirm I had left it. I asked them to hold it until Monday when I would be returning through the area. When I arrived to pick it up, it had magically disappeared from the drawer the girl had put it in, with the post it labelling it as mine. Do yourself a favor. Avoid this place.

Text: Room they gave us had not been cleaned since last guest. They upgraded us to jacuzzi suite. They were nice about it. It was not very clean either, A/C very noisy, a lot of highway noise.  Other guests (truckers) drinking cases of beer by the pool. They were loud and playing a boom box. The motel 6 next door can't be worse.
