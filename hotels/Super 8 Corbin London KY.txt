Text: We needed a room to sleep while traveling with a 26' box Penske Moving truck.  Big truck for many motels/hotels.  The room was clean, there carpet was gone and replaced with vinyl plank flooring.  I have those in my home.  Great stuff.  This may have been because my room was handicap accessible.  Anyway, nice TV, Fridge, Microwave.  Room was clean, desk clerk was pleasant and reasonable for a room to sleep in while traveling.  I would stay again while traveling.

Text: The whole hotel smells horrible. I had to go buy frebreeze and spray everything I used half The bottle!  The carpet is stained everywhere. The a.c. works poorly. I was pulling other people's  hairs from the sheets. Gross! No elevator. Won't stay again!
