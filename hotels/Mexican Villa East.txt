Text: Always look forward to the burrito enchilada style but they burnt the cheese on top. Mexican Villa on S. Campbell is better

Text: Worst food ever, la housinda is the best mexican food ever. This place is not welcoming, salsa was watered down and nasty, who puts paprika on guamolie? Chips were not fresh. Best thing that was served was the soda! I got the Sancho Enchilada and didn't get the rice or beans that was said was served with it. Dirty floors, staff unfriendly. I wish I could give zero stars. Nothing genuine about the food here other then would make a terd..... Will NEVER come back here!

Text: My parents have been taking me here since I was old enough to chew solid food, and I've been coming ever since! The food is always delicious. Definitely my favorite place to eat out.
