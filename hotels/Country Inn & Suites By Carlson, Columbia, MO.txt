Text: Hotel is clean and appeared to have been recently renovated.  Good hot breakfast.  Reasonable pricing.  But ceilings must be paper thin.  I could hear every step the person above me took.  Also the toilet in my room didn't flush.  Kind of just filled up with water and then gradually gurgled away down the drain...  Okay for number 1's kinda.  I reported to the desk and they kind of just shrugged their shoulders.  So, unfortunately, I had to leave the cleaning staff a present.

Text: Convenient to I 70.  Very clean & comfortable room.  The bathroom sparkled! The only shortcomings had to do with breakfast: it started too late for everyone as there was a line  before the door even opened at 7 am and then the room was too small for all the guests. The food was just ok. Overall a pleasant stay.

Text: Excellent room. We stayed on the top floor away from the elevator. Even so there was a rowdy guest room that we had to call the desk about. They got immediate attention and it was dealt with. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Sausage eggs biscuits and gravy. Cereal and pastry and even yogurt was offered. Other than the other guests issue it was a perfect visit.

Text: Everything was great BESIDES the lady who worked at night with the braids. WORSE ATTITUDE , WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE . my spouse is military and we are on a fast pcs and i forgot my service dogs paperwork. When i called the very nice lady who booked my room was very nice about it . Now the lady at night , rolled her eyes , was so rude about it , it just made our already long day and drive just so much worse.  Besides getting super rude and eye rolling service , everything else is great.  I gave it 2 stars for her. After hours and hours of driving getting attitude is the worse thing to get from a hotel worker.
