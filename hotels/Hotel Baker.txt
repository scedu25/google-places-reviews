Text: Such a beautiful building, went for drinks for girls night out. I would have loved to stay but the crowd was a much older scene with a live jazzy piano player. We ended up leaving and going to a more age appropriate bar.

Text: Everything is very nice and the staff is amazing but too noisy (music until midnight). I would recommend as a weekend place, NOT for work. The shuttle driver is the best!

Text: Great place,  not so great staff.  Had a wedding here and the cleaning crew threw out a gift from the groom in our hotel room and when asked about it they laughed at me saying it's got to be long gone in the dumpster.  Also left some shoes on accident in my room and they claimed they never saw them.

Text: I went once before to eat at the restaurant was really good the location is on a busy road but there's a parking garage one block away plus more food places right next to the hotel
