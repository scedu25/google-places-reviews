Text: Have only eaten there on Friday nights. All you can eat cat fish and two sides $9.99. Freshly cooked delicious. Very tough if it set a while before serving. Cole slaw good and also the fruit cobblers. Very nice servers and owners.

Text: Great stay, John did everything possible to make our weekend of fishing as comfortable as possible. Including getting to the restaurant early so we had a great breakfast to start our day. Thanks to John, his wife and staff.
