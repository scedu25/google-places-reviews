Coachlight RV Sales & Service
Rating: 1
Text: Bought a used nuway hitchhiker from coachlight a couple of years ago. Two weeks after purchase noticed leaking . Took it to them said they would fix they had it for a week and fixed nothing. Called them to tell them still wasn't fixed and they flat out told me it wasn't their problem.  Will not purchase another rv, fifth wheel or pull behind from them again.

Text: They are the textbook definition of outstanding customer service.  Bought a new Jayco fifth wheel and it was the smoothest vehicle purchase I've had in 44 years.  Negotiations with the owner were fast and extremely fair.  He was able to find us a better loan rate than I could find by myself.  Answered every question I had in detail.  My wife noticed a piece of trim that was messed up on our initial walk through and they had it fixed before we came down for the pre-delivery inspection without us even mentioning it.  They gave us access to a heated area with electrical and water hookups so that we could test all of the systems.  Found 3 or 4 very minor issues and they had them all fixed, the trailer winterized, and us hitched up and on the road an hour or two later.  Gave us all kinds of free extras for the RV and 10% off on everything in the store.  Sales staff A+.  Shop guys A++.  I will recommend them to anyone looking for a top notch RV shopping experience and they've earned my business for life.
