Text: Stayed here one night after a tubing trip nearby. The room was pleasantly furnished, had plenty of bedding, and the firepit and firewood was readily available. Would definitely consider staying here again in the future after another such tubing trip.

We stayed in the Kite Room, which some of the decorations can be seen in my attached photo.

Text: Very nice hosts.  Certainly the best accommodations within an hour, with the added benefit of a quiet location, close to a scenic river.  Loved the guinea hens!
