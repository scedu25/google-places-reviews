Text: I have been a guest here many times and am generally very pleased with the experience. This stay this time is good, not great. The staff is friendly like always, it's a very comfortable environment. The free breakfast is great, lots of choices. Generally waffles, hot and cold cereals, juices, breakfast breads (muffins, bagels, etc) and many other options. If I had anything negative to say, it really is a minor thing, however noticeable. You can tell the building itself is starting to need some maintenance. Carpets are looking dirty, cracks in the paint and flooring in the bathroom, stains on the upholstery on the furniture, the ac not getting as cold as it should. I think I'm general it may doesn't feel as squeaky clean as usual now that it's been operating for several years. A few minor touches and I'd have given it 5 stars, but again these small things are certainly no reason not to stay here. On the whole it's definitely a good value with many amenities (pool and gym, library, etc). Very comfortable stay!

Text: Not pleased with stay.   Front desk worker named Sandy is very very rude,  her attire is unprofessional,    The hotel itself is in dire need of rehabbing.   Carpet is filthy, stains on chairs and walls.    And a very musty smell though the entire hotel.       Pass on this place!!!!

Text: Fleas....lots of bad customer service. ..handicapped room on 3rd floor & in case of fire, use stairs so carry your disabled person down stairs. I m elderly myself,  how do I do that? Toilet didn't work. No maintenance on weekends so .....deal with it.  Lots of stories and this was just the first night. Whew!
