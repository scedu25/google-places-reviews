Text: They offer a free shuttle to the airport. We were traveling with a bunch of gear and the shuttle is huge and comfy!!! The suites were huge and had a separate door which was great for privacy. Friendly staff and a spotless facility. The parking is well lit and there were lots of spots, we were able to park our van right by the entrance!

Text: Holiday Inn Suites at O’Hare is a great hotel, and as the name says, very close to O’Hare International Airport. We didn’t use the hotel for the proximity to the airport, but traveling for business, but it still met our needs. This is a clean, modern hotel with a helpful staff, that let us check in and out late. There was ample room for loading our luggage into the hotel and the staff answered any questions we would need to get situated. The rooms were large and included a microwave, fridge and kitchenette. The parking lot was well lit and there was plenty of parking after we checked in. Wifi is free and accessing it was no problem. This is a comfortable, clean and extremely functional hotels for travelers, whether it’s for business or personal. After a day of travel, whether it’s a plane or car, this is the perfect hotel.

Text: This was a lovely hotel. I wish I needed to stay for more than one night. The best were comfortable and the layout was great. The employees I spoke with at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. The view was also lovely. It was fun to watch the planes coming into O'hare. It was surprisingly quiet for how close to the airport the hotel is. I didn't hear a sing plane through the night. However I feel bad for anyone over 5'5 who wanted to take a shower as I felt like I giant in the shower. I had to crouch in order to wash my hair. Also the housekeepers could do a little better of a job. There is a comfy chair in the room that I moved to get a better angle for watching television. When I moved it there were crumbs and papers under the chair. It looked the the chair hadn't been moved or vacuumed under in weeks. Also when I used the keurig in the morning there was a used K-cup in the machine. I was a housekeeper at one point and my place of employment never would have let me get away with that.

Text: The hotel was very accommodating for our night. My stay there was just for one night so we could fly out at the airport the next morning. They provided a shuttle to the airportand offered extended parking for our vehicle while we were on our trip. Overall our experience was very good.

Text: Came back to my car after a VERY long day of travel to find a dead battery. Ugh! The employees at the Holiday Inn were SO nice and SO helpful, and immediately provide me with a portable jump kit! Within minutes I was on the road with a charged battery! Thank you for saving the day!
