Text: Great hotel great prices for night stay. I'm sure it's good even for longer stays. They had drive thru check in I'd never seen that before. I checked in around 12 midnight and it went really fast. Rooms were great and the building was new.. I hope they continue to maintain it I will definitely come again. FYI breakfast can be better.. it almost finished by 8:45 in morning.

Text: I read reviews about bed bugs, so I was kinda concerned wheb I came in.  Turns out I had mining to worry about, but it also wasn't amazing.  Warm bed and all.  Bathroom was a little tight and if we're being honest the showerhead was a little concerning.  I thought it might fall off at times

Text: I do not like writing negative reviews. But I cannot forget what happened here.
The pictures describe the condition of the room when I checked in. You do not expect this even from a cheapest motel. 
When I informed the lady at front desk, she said she could not help as there were no other rooms available. While I turned back, she said something to one of the guy over there and they started laughing. This is not what one would expect from a "Help" desk !
Service is poor. People are not friendly. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Text: Don't expect more than the existing stereotype.  But this place was especially grungy, grimy. Police were there the morning we left. Was hoping that because of the area and right off the highway it would be one of the better ones. Sleep in your clothes.

Text: I had a child support warrant I was unaware of. This hotel apparently gives  names of all guests to the local police. On my last night of a five night stay the Police department is knocked on my door stating I had a warrant and took me to jail. Lesson learned.
