Text: Great place for the price. I was able to book a room at the last minute during the mass exodus traffic jam from the eclipse for my family. I was expecting far worse but its not that bad. This place has a lot of potential to improve. I hope that the influx of cash into the hotel from the eclipse visitors will help update and fix up the rooms. The lady at the front desk was nice, professional and helpful.

Text: Update: We were waiting for an hour to get in because the site we booked with overbooked the place; this I can forgive. However the room has a distinctive look of cleaning neglect & there's a very strong smell, overlaid by the strong smell of some cleaner trying to cover the 1st smell up. On the other hand, it is much better than the last budget hotel we were in & a perfectly good relief to a long day of driving/unexpected hotel stop. Thanks for finding a room for us guys!

Text: Price was right, but no hot water in our room even after letting it run for a while. To late to complain and didn't want to change rooms. For an over nighter, it was ok.
