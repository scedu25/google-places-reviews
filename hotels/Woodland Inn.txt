Text: I stayed the weekend Friday thru Monday. Watched a lot of movies been wanting to see. I went fishing in the big stream walking distance. Ate Mexican food in town across the stream, also had a wonderful full country buffet on Sunday. Staff is educated and know the area and proud of the fact.
I would stay again if in the area. Really nice.
