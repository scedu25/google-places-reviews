Text: Great continental breakfast! Pool was a bit chilly but nice area. The room was clean and very nice, other than missing shampoo and having a used lotion that a person couldn't notice other than the bottle had some on the top. The staff that I had spoke to were pleasant. The location was easy to get to from the interstate.
