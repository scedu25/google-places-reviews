Hampton Inn Sidney

Text: Read this before you pass this up from old reviews. Everything is new or recently replaced . Amazing staff and breakfast. This hotel has many amenities you don't expect. The rooms are quiet and the beds are comfortable. There is an indoor heated pool, laundry machines, refrigerator and microwave in the rooms. There is an internet type room with a printer and a computer. The gym is small but they will gladly give you free passes to the local gym. And as far as the air not working when the outside temperature is below 71 degrees the actual temperature it shuts off at is when the outdoor temp is below 61 which is pretty cold. The only thing that needs attention is the mold in the air conditioning register it the room a/c . I will attach a picture. Know though that Ohio is a humid place and this is normal for a place that gets the a/c run a lot. Overall a really nice stay.

Text: Hampton Inns are lovely hotels. The rooms are very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The staff is very friendly and professional. The pool is wonderful and their breakfasts simply are amazing. I love staying at Hampton Inns. My only problem is that Hilton Hotels really stink when it comes to their VERY unreasonable policies concerning cancellations. My unhappiness with Hilton will come into play when staying at Hampton Inns in the future.

Text: We have stayed here many times and really like the hotel.  However, this last time we stayed here we booked on-line and paid the lower non-refundable rate.  When we received our credit card bill we noticed that we were charged twice.  We called the hotel and they blamed it on corporate and gave us an 800 number to call.  After 45 minutes of calling guest services and having our call disconnected we finally spoke with someone who was able to help us.  The person at guest services blamed the hotel.   We were finally reimbursed and received a check from the company.  However, there was no compensation for the inconvenience and error.  Guests services didn't care when I told them we will be less likely to stay at a Hampton in the future.

Text: This place was VERY nice. The rooms were large and very clean. We got in at 2am, and the man who checked us in was still chipper and sweet. We'll definitely be staying here again.
