Four Keys Motel
Rating: 3
Text: A cheap motel to spend the night in when you are traveling in Portsmouth, OH. The room was clean, had a TV, a comfortable bed, and the bathroom worked. It is definitely an old motel with no additional services. If that's all you need then it's a good value. If you want anything else then this would not be the place for you.

Text: I have stayed here several times . and have never had a problem. Last stay the kind lady who helped me was amazing.. I was in need of adjoining rooms and she was kind enough to the the screws in the doors removed so I could get what I needed. I will most definitely be staying there again!

Text: Don't ever come here. This place is a dump. Cigarette burns in the blankets. Stains on the pillows. Cobwebs and dust everywhere. Holes in the wall. So stuffy I got a nose cold. Not even worthy of one 1-star. Not even sure how they pass inspection. Yes, it's that bad!!!

Text: Warm bed and hot shower after the dtwc. Not the Ritz but affordable and better than a tent. Staff was friendly.
