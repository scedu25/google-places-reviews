Zane Shawnee Caverns and Southwind Park
Rating: 5
Text: The Caverns and Campground are such a beauty to behold. Whether summer or winter, the caves are always the same temperature. There are cabins to rent for winter camping, too! Not being far from town, this makes the perfect get away for anyone. You can swim, or fish or even hike the grounds and be one with nature. Really a great spot to frequent!

Text: Bathrooms are few and far between. Only aware of 1 shower area and all needed cleaning.  Tour of cave seemed fine but information was all based on fiction and stories told.Facts given about gelogical structure and discovery seemed to be made up and not reserched.

Text: Unless you are Ted Julian who writes reviews and loves to speed through things and complain because it is not a Courtyard by Marriott for which he seems to feel at home at.This place is a Semi-Modern campground with Water and Electricity. If you are more into nature and not the KOA style campground, this is a great place.They Have Great events and are very knowledgeable about their history. The Museum has some very interesting pieces and the cave is really interesting. One of the better ones I have been in. I camp there at least 4 to 6 times a year. The Pow-Wows are a great time to come and are enjoyable.
