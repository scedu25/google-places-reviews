Text: Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hoosier Horse Camp back in May.  Being my first time, they kindly offered me a custom map of the trails, which are only a short ride down the road.  Camp site was clean with brand new covered stalls.  Only fault was the lime wasn't packed yet but with time will be great!

Text: After paying too much money for the last time at Midwest, still a good place but too expensive, we decided to move on. Headed down to what I thought was Monk's Mule Camp and found these nice folks. The site is under construction but all I was interested in was a spot to sit and a hitchin post. They weren't open yet but accommodated us. Real close to the trails in Hoosier National Forest and worth the effort to get to them. Our new go-to campground for sure. Thanks, Daryl

Text: Love camping here. They treat everyone like family. Clean showers, other facilities as well.. very accommodating. In the Hoosier National Forrest . The best Horse camp in the area hands down. Midwest used to be my place of choice but they treat people poorly and they are more pricey, it's sad..So Hoosier Horse Camp is mine and my other horsey friends favorite camping place.
