Text: I came to stay here last minute as my Mom and Step-Father were in town from Dallas, TX. This place is most certainly a hidden treasure. I had such a great time, and the owners/innkeepers were the most kind, hospitable people around! It was a beautiful quarter and the breakfast was divine! Great memory! I will return and tell others about it!
