Text: There is not much that can be done to make this a worse place. A direct hit with a meteorite would technically have to be considered gentrification.

Text: never stayed there Live Locally  have needed on occassion to stay away from home while construction,but this place is frightening. it is next to a converted gasoline station to a licquor store,across from a 7/11 type gasoline and  mini market/Puveyors of  more  achohol . Both seem to attract the local homeless population and with the availability of  2 freeway offramps closeby  neverending group of panhandlers/ homeless . recent murder in the area by  2 of these  types,and  lately many  burglaries in close neighborhood. With little police response. makes the less than inviting area
