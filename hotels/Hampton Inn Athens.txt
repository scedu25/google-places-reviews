Text: Very nice hotel.  Not on my route but since it was booked we stayed and we're very happy with the staff an amenities at this hotel.  King room was very clean and linen was crisp.

Text: My stay was very short here as I got in around 0200, but it appears to be one of the more modern Hampton Inns. Front desk staff were very friendly, and room was clean. Hotel is nicely situated on a hill, so it looks out over the outskirts of Athens. One nice thing about being in a College town, there are a dozen places that deliver well into the early morning

Text: This is a very beautiful hotel with spectacular views of the Hocking Hills. The staff is wonderful, especially Chazz, who goes out of his way to make your stay a fabulous one. The swimming pool is really fun and the hot tub is amazing! The beds are very very comfortable. The cleaning staff does a great job keeping the rooms nice, clean, and comfortable. My only complaint would be that the breakfast is not very good AT ALL. Other than that, very nice hotel. My go to spot when I'm in Athens.
