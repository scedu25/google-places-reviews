I Hotel and Conference Center
Rating: 5
Text: Great rooms for a decent price, especially if you're going to an event at the State Farm Center next door. The room we had was a double queen and had now then enough space for the 4 of us. Bathrooms were immaculate, beds smelled clean and looked fresh. The staff was friendly even though we checked in at a very busy time and made sure we were happy. Highly recommended.

Text: Stayed here two nights for a conference. Great location of you're heading to a sporting event on campus - just across the street from everything. Clean modern room with OK views. Lobby area was cool with a lot of modern touches. Wireless was iffy throughout the whole property. I ended up just turning it off. Oh yeah, there's a Starbucks so that's worth a star on its own.

Text: Extremely positive experiences working with their conference center staff.  We've held several meetings there and they are a well-oiled machine!  Right after booking, people from each department reach out to see what type of support you'll need (catering, technology, etc).  The execution is seamless.  Thanks I hotel!

Text: They have conference hosting down to an art form. The decor, location, and food are perfectly fine, though not memorable. The audio/video setup is excellent. I was particularly impressed with the pleasant, friendly and professional catering staff. I did not stay in the hotel overnight, so I can't comment on the accommodations.

Text: Spacious conference rooms; very attentive conference center staff. The only drawback this time while I attended a conference at the I Hotel was that we could tell the a/v equipment is aged. We had many difficulties over two days, but the staff did a good job of taking care of us.
