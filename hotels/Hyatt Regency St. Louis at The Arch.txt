Text: The Ruth's Chris Steakhouse restaurant is at the bottom of this hotel. I took a client there for dinner. They gave me a seat against the window which you can see the entire Arch. It was very nice. As usual, Ruth's Chris food is always fantastic. It was a very nice location for a great steak dinner. Great View.

Text: Stayed at this hotel while attending a work conference. Very nice rooms and I have to say if you are going to be sight seeing, this would be a great place to stay. I could actually see the arch from my hotel room (only 1 block away). The brew house restaurant and bar inside of the hotel was great and we had the best food on our trip there. They also had a great list of local micro brews. I would highly recommend!

Text: Service was great. Parking bothered me. When I pulled up they asked if I wanted to valet or if I would be willing to self park. I told him I didn't mind parking myself. He then advised me that their hotel garage was closed to self parking guests that night and I ended up having to to drive a block and parking in another hotels garage and walking back. Other than that, the room was very clean, the TV was nice, view was good. My wife was disappointed when she saw that there wasn't a pool. I would definitely stay there again, just be mindful of self parking next time is all. And not having a pool didn't really bother me too much

Text: This hotel is in a great location! It is right downtown next to the arch. It is a nice hotel. The rooms are spacious and up to date. The beds are a little uncomfortable, but not too bad. This is why I deducted 1 star. Otherwise a very nice hotel with good customer service and amenities. I would stay there again, especially if they update their beds.

Text: I only attended a conference here, but did not stay at the hotel. So this review is for the hotel common space and conference space. Hyatts are typically very modern in design, but this hotel is showing its age. It generally feels old and in need of a major renovation. That being said, it is functional as a conference venue and the hotel staff have been helpful. Their A/V team is absolutely top notch for presentations!
