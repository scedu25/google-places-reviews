PJ's Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Great place. Same family (extended family now I think) runs it now as when it was the tumbleweed hotel. 
Rooms are small but clean. Price is amazing. There are microwaves and mini fridge in the room. Owner is super nice and helpful.  Place is very quiet unlike the oak tree hotel down the road. No issue sleeping here.  New place of choice when in town for extended times for work.
