Text: Stayed here while spending time at the State Fair. Loved the bed's, almost had to jump into it. Room was more than I expected for the cost. The owners upgraded the room with new AC and refrigerator and microwave. Very convenient for me. I would stay here again.

Text: We stayed here before... Good.  This was the third time... The last time!  Couldn't sleep in the bed because of the musky smell....$110.00..of our hard earned money. Checked out around 10:00 pm. Asked manager to adjust our bill and refund something.... He said that we didn't complain about it when we checked in. I didn't realize the stench until I pulled the sheets up around my face.... I told him.  To no avail!  Will not be recommending to anyone!!!  If you do... Don't take the one at the very end!

Text: Clean and very quiet, at first. The railroad runs right behind the motel. The rooms are not cleaned every day and you have to ask for clean towels.

Text: The rooms are clean and comfortable, but the motel is adjacent to a major highway and railroad tracks, so it tends to be a little noisy there at times. Oh, and they could stand to give you more than two small pillows on the bed...

Text: Our stay was great. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. A train goes by a lot but I'm used to it. The only thing is that the towels could use an upgrade and the bathrooms some work. I will for sure stay again!
