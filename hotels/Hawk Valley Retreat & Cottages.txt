Text: Excellent B&B.  Host Hal and Wendy awesome.  Very friendly and helpful with area sites.  Breakfast is out of this world.  Very clean, quiet, and well maintained.  Would recommend to everyone.  This was our very first bed and breakfast. Loved this place.  Definitely will be back.

Text: We at first  had reserved  a room  in the bed and  breakfast.  When we arrived I saw  that  they  also  had  cabins. They  had a couple of cabins available. We  rented one and  absolutely loved it.  From  the rocking chairs on the back porch, the hot tub , fire place,the woods  and  the friendly people, it was  perfect
