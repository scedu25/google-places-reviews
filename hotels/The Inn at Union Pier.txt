The Inn at Union Pier
Rating: 5
Text: We been coming here since 1990's when the inn opened after major renovations. It remains our frequent get away from the hassles of a city life. It is welcoming, friendly, and charming. Rooms are relaxing, fire places are a hoot, breakfast tasty, Red Arrow highway filled with restaurants and shops. Enjoy!

Text: Historic atmosphere, great location within a block of Lake Michigan. Food was good to.  Rooms in the part we stayed don't have much soundproofing but still a nice experience.
