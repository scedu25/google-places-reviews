Text: Great campground. Plenty off trees for shade. Not very private. But has a great store, and plenty of stuff for three kids to do. Basketball courts, volleyball, beach area, swings and play ground. Plenty off walking trails. And right in the park.

Text: Great campground with tons of amenities. You can go from full hookups for campers to primitive for these who like it rustic. There are showers, bathrooms, and laundry facilities. Lots of trails and stuff for kids. This is camping with convenience.

Text: I a 72 yo. I started camping at HF in the early 70's. My daughter literally grew up here. HF has improved and grown in campsites but still has a very safe atmosphere. Children, young old can enjoy camping here without fear of being harmed. 
We just today returned home, only now, we have grandchildren. Harder now to keep up. lol.
HF has a very well supplied Outpost. Movies, groceries, ice & etc.
Come, camp and enjoy.

Text: We recently camped at Hillman Ferry and had an experience worth making public. Upon arriving to the campground, we were greeted at the front gatehouse by an employee name Jerri. She made us feel at home immediately. She was kind and pleasant in answering our questions and guiding us through the map of the campgrounds. With deliberate and thorough communications in answering our questions, she made us feel instantly welcome. We were impressed, to say the least. If you camp at Hillman Ferry, I hope you have the pleasure to interact with this professional.
