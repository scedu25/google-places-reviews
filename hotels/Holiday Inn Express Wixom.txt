Text: Comfortable. However it is out dated and the beds are horrible. Toilets have too much water  and are uncomfortable to sit on.
Rating: 5
Text: Room was clean, the staff was excellent. Buffet breakfast had turkey sausage, bit also had bacon so that was not a problem. Free coffee all day long. Older building might bother some people. As with the older buildings, not many outlets. I would stay there again.

Text: First time there. Beautiful surrounding areas,  beautiful establishment. Everything about our stay  was everything we wanted it to be. Only met two staff members but they were helpful and courteous. My wife and I will be back.
