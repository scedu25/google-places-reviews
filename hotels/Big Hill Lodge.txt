Text: My wife and kids really enjoyed every moment in our large spacious room.  With full size kitchens comfortable beds and great surroundings we had a wonderful experience. It was very convenient to check in the rooms were very comfortable and affordable.  Although we were visiting family we spent most of our time back at the room and had a blast.
