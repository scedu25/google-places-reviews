Text: Fantastic place to stay!
Very very clean, OUTSTANDING customer service and every staff member we met was very nice and would stop and talk to our toddler. Free breakfast, free dinner, and 3 free alcoholic drinks from the bar as well as a pool and Jacuzzi and free popcorn and soda!

Wonderful place and very pretty.

Text: The indoor pool/hot tub was nice. Enjoyed the free food and drinks for their 5:30 kickback offer. Super friendly staff, quickly addressed any issues or concerns we had. Had a small issue without room and they resolved it right away.

Text: This was by far, the best Drury that we have ever stayed at. Every staff member we ran Into was extremely  nice and went out of their way to be helpful. The first night, it was  too warm in the room. The nice gentleman came to our room and checked the unit out. He even offered to get us a fan.  Problem solved. 

I love the history behind this hotel and how well it is displayed throughout. There was so much to do within walking distance.  We will definitely be back. Thanks for the hospitality.

Text: Stayed here for Strange Loop 2017. Was my first time at a Drury Inn, and it was awesome. Old fashioned feel, but very clean and well maintained. Three free drinks (!) at the bar every night from 5:30-7, great breakfast, and bonus reward points for each day you decline housekeeping. Recommended!

Text: Rooms are a good size and clean. They do a good job with the extra perks. Both breakfast and 5:30 Kickback have good variety and taste good. Pool is fairly small, but sufficient for a little play time. Hot tub is great and not crowded. Very pleasant stay and would recommend.
