Text: I have nothing but WONDERFUL things to say about this place. The Rogge family were so catering and very easy to work with. The Cabin was nice and clean for us to stay in and the beds were comfy. The barn is absolutely beautiful. I didn't really need to do a whole lot of decorating. Highly recommend getting married or having any kind of event here.

Text: If you are looking for a wedding or events venue in Southern Nebraska, you've got to check this place out. I've been to several events at the Cedar Prairie Barn, and the place has a great country feel all around. If you need lodging, there is an adjacent lodge that sleeps up to about 20 people. The Rogge family couldn't be a nicer bunch of people.
