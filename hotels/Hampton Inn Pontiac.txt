Hampton Inn Pontiac
Rating: 5
Text: Our Hampton Inn stay was a good experience. 5 star for customer service from front desk personnel, kitchen worker, and person emptying trash next to coffee bar who took time out to bring me packets of honey for tea after kitchen was closed. Everyone gave exceptional and cheerful service. The breakfast was great with a nice variety to choose from. Our room was very clean and nice. Only thing that made it just a little less than perfect was that the room could have used the option of lighter weight blankets instead of just a heavy comforter. Hats off to the employees at Hampton Inn in Pontiac, Illinois!

Text: Very disappointing. Nearly brand new hotel. The smoke alarm had  2  small strobe lights that flash above the bed every 3 seconds. At 1:15am the fire alarm goes off. An hour later they are calling people to explain why the alarms are going off. The bed was so firm, it was like sleeping on the floor. I was looking forward to a good night's  sleep after driving almost 9 hours straight. Definitely didn't get it here. They offered me a soda to make up for it.

Text: Very nice front desk staff. Room was very clean, had lots of towels and pillows. Other than the breakfast being slightly lacking, it's hard to beat everything else. Plus, very  veteran-friendly business.
