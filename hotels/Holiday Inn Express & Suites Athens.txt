Holiday Inn Express & Suites Athens
Rating: 4
Text: Our room was very comfortable, everything seemed clean and fresh. We seemed to have an issue with the water in the shower, it was so sensitive and only went to burning hot or freezing cold. But, they seem to be doing some renovations and another room we stayed in was perfect! I love the tv channels and movies they offer, the breakfast was great, and it's a good location to drive to the must-see areas in Ohio(=
