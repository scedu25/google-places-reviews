Text: Long overdue review. Stayed for a honeymoon trip, 9/10 owners left out of town on our second night stay and left their dog barking through the night. Horrible experience, didn't sleep, husband had food poisoning. Very unprofessional.

Text: We highly recommend The HS Clay House in Augusta, MO ... First class service and attention to detail! We rented the entire house and guest house for an intimate wedding with family. Leigh & Alan were wonderful hosts and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Alan is a talented chef. You can tell they love what they do! Book a room for a romantic get-a-way, or a personal retreat — you won't be disappointed.

Text: The innkeepers at the HS Clay house were such great hosts.  We stayed in the Tree Top Suite for an anniversary get away from the kids. Only a short drive from St Louis, with lots of extra amenities and a breakfast that will amaze you. Certainly will plan on another visit next year.  thank you!
