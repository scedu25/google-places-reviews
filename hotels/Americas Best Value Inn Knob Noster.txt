Text: I have been coming to this location for several years ( family n this town). I'm pleased to say that the current MGT ( Ms Mimi) has been so good to me and my family. I'll always use this facility as long as I remain to visit this area.
Mimi and her staff are always as accommodating as they can be.
I've been intending to do this for a long time but don't have a computer and just learned to do this on my phone. 
I would recommend this location to all who pass this way. If you stay please tell her Edna sent you.
Nice, clean and Ms Mimi is incredible.

Text: Honestly deserves less than one star. Tried to get a room at around 10pm the other night, the lady working the desk was rude from the start. When we walked in she was on the phone, I thought she was telling me she needed a minute, but I realized she was telling that to the person on the phone after she glared at me for a few moments. I asked if there were any rooms available for the night and she asked how old I was. I told her I was 18 and that my friend was 19. I was barely done speaking when she blurted out "no" and that we couldn't get a room. Ended up driving to Warrensburg to find somewhere to stay.

Text: It's not the nicest hotel, which is what I expected coming to this tiny town but our group got here and the rooms were all far apart and the first room we were given was dirty (trash everywhere, bed unmade, etc) when we went back to the front desk they said their computer said that. Well why did they give us the room then? Overall not the cleanest place which is pretty much all I ask for of a hotel.
