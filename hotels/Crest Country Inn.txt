Text: Loved this place. They have pet friendly rooms, for a small fee. Beautiful yard area for pet to roam and owner too!   Room was spot on clean and cozy. Very quiet and relaxing. Loved the owners, and if it means anything to you,  they are christian folk. If it doesn't,  dont worry,  nothing that will offend you either way!  Will definitely stay again any time we are passing through.

Text: I had stayed at this motel ten years ago or so and knowing I was going to need to stop on this trip, I remembered it and decided to try again.  I was not disappointed.  If anything, it's improved.  Rooms are super-clean and comfortable.  It's old, but well-maintained and seems to be a real 'mom-n-pop' family business with very friendly owners who seem to think of everything.  These kind of places usually don't do breakfast or at most some bad muffins and coffee, but they have managed to set up a dining area in a hall that has good coffee and juice, breads and a selection of frozen breakfast sandwiches and burritos that can be microwaved.  The price was very reasonable and the location- just across from Tanger Outlets and near fast food and convenience stores, and just off I-80- is great.

Text: Very nice and clean family-run motel. Rooms have a country theme. Area is very quiet. There are a few different places to eat nearby and an outlet mall down the hill and across the street, all within walking distance if you prefer.
