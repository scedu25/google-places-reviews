Anchor Inn Boutique Hotel

Text: My wife and I stayed here over the weekend of 6/24/17. The accommodations were excellent. The rooms are nicely furnished, up to date and very clean. The food prepared for breakfast was excellent both mornings. We were very pleased with the close proximity to downtown yet not in the middle of all the noise when we needed a break. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful also.

Text: The hotel was clean upon arrival and looked beautiful. We were given our key and went to our room. We were in the Second Mate's room. It was beautiful! King sized bed, shower with rain head, separate tub, smart TV, and a private balcony. So why only 4 stars? There were very limited breakfast options for those who don't eat pork products and the did not clean our room. We put our sheets on the floor to be changed and they put them right back on the bed. They did not clean the tub, shower or the toilet. I understand that it is a "go green" hotel but if you ask us to put items we want changed on the floor, then they should be changed. When we visit Put in Bay in the future I'm sure this hotel will be high on our list of places to stay, but I'm disappointed in the lack of cleaning that was done in our room. Good thing we're not slobs.

Text: We had a crazy experience here.  The business overbooked its rooms on a Saturday night.  The innkeeper rousted us at 4am with local cops in tow and made us leave.  There is literally nowhere to go on this island, so we walked around the island until the ferry arrived the following morning.  The staff was horrible throughout this ordeal.  Stay away!
