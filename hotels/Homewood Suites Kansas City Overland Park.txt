Text: Dated, disorganized and kind of dirty...  We stayed here for 2 weeks - the room was decent, but there were some serious issues with the flooring. Obviously, the dishwasher had flooded previously so there was a huge dip in the floor. We found bottles of tequila in the upper cabinets of the kitchen which was kind of weird. The hotel just never seemed clean and I think that is because it is so dated and worn. Our final straw was when we saw silverfish (insects) in the kitchen. We left the next morning for a different hotel. During our stay, we consistently had to request more towels from the front desk - and there were several times when no one was at the front desk at all.  The pool was nice, as well as the breakfasts/dinners. Overall, it was an "okay" experience, but definitely NOT a Hilton experience.

Text: We felt that they should be given a medal for keeping it running smoothly while under construction. Very happy.

Text: Air conditioning does not work-at 77 degrees returning after a 14 hour work day so set it to 65. This morning it was down to 71 degrees. The sink faucet has to be played with to find the right spot to get hot water. Television cuts out so you only hear half of the words. Reported the issue with TV so it was fixed one day and back to the same problem the next day. Tried calling front desk about the air but they said call back cause they were busy. Thank his for ceiling fan cause too tied after very intense work schedule.

Text: I absolutely loved my stay here. The room was large, clean and I felt safe staying alone. Loved the evening reception which included wine and food. I will for sure stay her again when in town.
