The Grand Kerr House
Rating: 5
Text: Our stay at the Kerr House was a home away from home experience. Bob and Cathy could not have done more for us. 

Since we have renovated a dozen or so homes, we were very interested in their efforts and extremely pleased with their accomplishments in restoring the home to its former grandeur.

Lovely folks; will stay with them again and again when the opportunity presents itself.

Kind Regards, Jim & Paula from Evanston, IL
