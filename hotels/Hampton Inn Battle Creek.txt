Text: This particular motel abides by their policy about not allowing the wife stay in a room their husband reserved over a week prior because the form of payment was in said husband's name and he was not with me at the time. The document I had stated the card used, which I had in possession, and amazingly our last names matched, but that was not good enough. On a side note I offered to call my husband to verify, but this was still not in accordance with said policy.
We have used this brand of hotel for years because they have always outdone themselves, but not again as we feel they did not specifically note their policy and the card was still charged for said room no one was allowed to utilize.

Text: The location was not the best in the city but the hotel and rooms were very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast was just ok but was good for what we needed. I would definitely stay there again.
