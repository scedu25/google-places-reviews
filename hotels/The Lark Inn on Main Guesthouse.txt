The Lark Inn on Main Guesthouse
Rating: 5
Text: Fantastic!  Spotless clean. All amenities provided. Slept all 10 of us easy.  Court house was good piece of prairie history. Went antique strolling down main drag, walking distance from house. *all beds are up stairs, so anyone with bad knees or handicapped take note- bright side - the sofas are  extra comfortable*
