Text: Clean rooms, only one elevator for fairly large foot print (had to walk a long way to get to room). Helpful staff. No breakfast was included, but there is a Starbucks in lobby. Small balconies for each room and large central courtyard.

Text: Didn't spend much time here as I was visiting for work but it's a very quiet location and it almost seems like you have the whole hotel to yourself.
