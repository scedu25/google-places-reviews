The Blue Heron Guest House

Text: We spent our anniversary weekend at the Guest House and enjoyed every second of it. The area was beautiful, the house was relaxing, and the town area surrounding the house had several great shops and restaurants. It was everything we were looking for in a weekend getaway.

Text: My in-laws stayed here when they came to visit. They said the property, the food, and their room was nice as could be and the owners were incredibly prepared and accommodating.

Text: I just got home from my second stay at the guest house. The first time we stayed in the Empyrean suite (which was a little over-the-top for my wife and I -- everything looked gilded in gold), and this time we stayed in the Heron's Nest (which was also richly furnished but more comfortable to my wife and I, plus it's on the second story so you can enjoy the view). 

What a gorgeous house! Such great hospitality. 

It was a wonderful experience. Kelly and Tony are really cordial and very accommodating. The boat taxi to Cerulean was awesome -- Tony took us on a great trip around the lake after dinner and we got to enjoy a lakeview sunset and some good tunes. 

I know there's another B&B in the village but I don't think I'll ever book there. Staying here feels like staying with family, and the setting is extremely relaxing. The upstairs rooms get access to a nice living-room area complete with coffee and water and a nice DVD collection, not to mention a sprawling view of the lake. Beautiful. The back yard is well laid-out and well-maintained, and features a nice fire pit and a landscaped fountain area. It's situated right on a sandbar so you can hop in and enjoy warm, shallow, muck-free wading. There's wildlife everywhere and people enjoying the lake. Love it. We will be back!
