Cranes' Place

Text: A very secluded get - away, perfect for a couple or a group gathering. We have stayed here twice, and enjoyed each time.

Text: Great getaway place for a family!  Sleeps up to 8 with the futon in the living room!  No cell phone or internet service, which was great because it kept our kids off of their "devices".  The house is clean, comfortable, and fairly secluded.  The only downside is you will need an all wheel drive vehicle to navigate the steep driveway.  We highly recommend staying here!
