Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago
Rating: 3
Text: Always have a great stay here. The bathroom with the separate water closet and jacuzzi style soaking tub are two of my favorite amenities, and their toiletries are always likeable. The staff is always polite and accommodating -- always enjoyable.  If there was a microwave in each room I'd easily give this place 4 -5 stars.

Text: Nice stay. Spacious rooms. Luxurious accommodation. 4 star rating because they have a weird policy of not allowing children and under 18 even to the hotel premises. High security inside casino. Very intimidating sometimes.

Text: I've stayed at the Ameristar before, but during this instance, I was at the seafood buffet. For those who love crab legs, going to this is great. The crab legs are high quality and for the most part, endless. For the casual seafood eater, the rest of the seafood is great. The only issue I had was the wait staff tended to forget about you once they've waited on you once or twice.

Text: This casino has a great staff.  They are very nice and personal.  Everything is clean and you always feel safe.  I gave it a three star review for the slots.  We've been going here for a long time and 2017 is their tightest year for slots.  Most of our friends eat here and go across the way to the other boat to play.

Text: We went there for the 1st time. The staff and everyone was friendly. We only played the slots and the machines actually were paying. Parking was easy and accessible. Will definitely go again when we are in town.
