New Victorian Inn & Suites - Kearney
Rating: 3
Text: The room wasn't anything special. The bed was comfortable, the free breakfast was filling & easy to take on the go. We booked at the New Victorian because the rating was relatively high & rooms priced reasonably. However, they charged us $79.99 for a room when the advertised price was $64.99, because we were booking "last minute." When we checked out the following morning, they had already charged our card & they would not refund us the difference. Our room was just inside a separate entrance in the back. The entrance was unlocked & that made us uncomfortable because the hotel is easily accessible from the main street. The non smoking & smoking rooms are intermixed, so there's really no point in the differentiation. We take this trip once or twice a year & definitely wouldn't stay there again.

Text: Check in was pleasant and accommodating, the room was clean with a desk and 2 chairs, microwave and fridge, large screen TV w/ cable channels. Bathroom was a little cramped (Tub & commode) separate sink vanity w/ mirror, shower pressure was minimal. Breakfast was good, biscuits n gravy, sweet rolls, bagels, cereal, toast, donuts yogurt, waffles, coffee, juice. Descent room rate for area,would stay if in area again.

Text: the room was super clean and quiet. Beds are amazingly comfortable. This is a real bargain in a town with very expensive rooms.
