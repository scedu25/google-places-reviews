Text: No longer a motel that I would stay in. It has  a coffee shop type restaurant out front of the motel, it's a little greasy spoon restaurant that has good home-cooked Comfort Foods, recomend the Fried Chicken

Text: Cheapest place around $580/month. But i can't handle sleeping with bed bugs. Took pictures and video, then brought a couple to the owner, he actually accused me of bringing them. Where the hell do you find those things? Do people actually travel with them as pets? I can understand after a couple weeks but one night.
