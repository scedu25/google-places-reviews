Text: Came here as part of a bridal party, and it was great! Staff was super accommodating at all hours of the night. We had all the space and amenities we needed to get ready for a beautiful, memorable evening, including sleeping a group of 5 the night before the big day. Would recommend to anyone looking for a bridal suite.

Text: Was here for sons wedding. Theresa was so helpful through whole process. Shawn was another person behind desk who couldn't be happier every time I talked to him and was very helpful. We used the conference room after wedding and the janitor the next day thanked us for somewhat cleaning up! Overall great place to stay and close to Ravina on the Lake venue. Rooms were nice and clean and had everything we needed!!!
Great place!

Text: Very nice rooms. We had the king suite, it had a sitting,desk, area, pocket doors to close off the bed/TV area, and a separate living room with a door, that included pull out couch and TV. Same rate as a double Queen room. Nice pool, and hot breakfast. Staff is friendly and prompt to address needs and questions. Very nice experience.
