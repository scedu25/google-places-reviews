Text: We've never stayed at a B&B before and Tony and Ann made our stay a fantastic experience. Ann's egg souffle and coffee cake were so filling. The chocolate cookies were the best I've ever eaten. The table was decorated so elegantly we felt like royalty. It was great to be able to use the kitchen and to have the whole house to ourselves. We will be back next time we're in town.

Ann is absolutely wonderful! She has a sunny disposition and has a wonderful inn!
We stayed in 2 of the rooms at different times, and both were beautiful.
The whole house is wonderfully decorated and we felt like we were at home instantly.
We did our own cooking, as she was out of town for the majority of our stays. The kitchen was fully stocked with spices, dishes and cookware, making it very easy to make our own meals.
The town has great people and is so friendly and warm. I really can't complain about any part of our stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling through or looking for a weekend getaway.

Text: I've really enjoyed my stay here with my sister.  We made ourselves at home. I loved going through all your magazines, reading the comments in these books and reviewing your work on this house photo album. What a project you took on. It was really fun visiting with you especially about the houses previous owner!  The cheesecake and the breakfst were perfect!  So many wonderful stores we enjoyed in the 18 mile radius of Waterville. Thanks for everything.
