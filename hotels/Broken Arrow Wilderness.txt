Text: We stayed in a cabin for a wedding & would not recommend it for anyone. The price was very high for what we found when we got there. Mold in the shower, killed lots of spiders even on our pillow & load A/C.

Text: Camped here several times. It was nice and clean. Did not have a problem with any dogs, many other campers brought theirs, but with no noise issue. I would stay there again.
