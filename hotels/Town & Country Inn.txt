Text: All in all, a nice place to stay. Close to anything you need,and clean. Like the new owners    this was the rating I gave 9 months ago. Now there are new owners, and things have  changed. Rates are higher, and after checking in that called me on the phone to inform me that thay wanted to charge 25 more dollars for my chawawa. Not to mention 100 dollar deposit now attached to this drama. Still no coffee in room, not breakfest, and just bad. I figured 3 years coming here would be a sigh of a good customer, guess I was  wrong

Text: Well... where to start.... ok. I have been staying in the same room here for over a month (not counting weekends) for work and have had the same room every time. In that time the linen has been changed 1/2 times.  (Only one bed) they no longer make the beds after "cleaning." There was food left over in the fridges from weeks before.  Found fleas in the bed.  (Pet friendly hotel)-ish)  first week here the lamp fell off the wall and management said it would be fixed before we returned (around 6pm)  took 2days. Some of the air conditioners are missing all of the cover and is just coils sitting in the open. (Dangerous?) Ok I think that's enough negative points (but not all) 

Now for the pro's
They have a room with a stove any one can use, with utensils.
Flat screen tv's
Some heaters work great
