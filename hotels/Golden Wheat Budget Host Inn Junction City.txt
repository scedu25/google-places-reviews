Text: Rented a room in June while passing through Kansas.  Room had a strong perfume/incense odor, threw open window and cranked on the A/C. Came back from dinner and still could not tolerate smell. Proprietor was extremely irritated at my request for a refund, Treated me rudely and only returned 1/2 price of room, after telling me to "Get Out and Never Come Back". I suggest you continue down Washington Street and shell out a few more $$ for a better night's sleep.
