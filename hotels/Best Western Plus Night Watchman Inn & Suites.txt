Best Western Plus Night Watchman Inn & Suites

Text: Greensburg is the halfway point for my dog and me on our annual trek to South Dakota for pheasant hunting.   This is the second year I've stayed here both ways, four stays total. This hotel really caters to people traveling with their pets and it's nice.  My room had a refrigerator and microwave and was on the first floor right next to the door to the pet relief area.  There are vacant lots for parking large vehicles with trailers next to the hotel's parking lot.  There are also wide quiet streets behind the hotel for a nice walk with a pet after they were couped up in the car all day. There is a pool and fitness center as well.  The fitness center has a stationary bike and treadmill and a few pieces of strength equipment,  but not free weights.  The hotel is located just a block from Kiowa County Hospital.  The breakfast bar has a good choice of hot and cold selections.

Text: I stayed one night at the Best Western in Greensburg, Kansas and I have to say was very impressed with how clean and up kept it was. The customer service was good and a complete breakfast for the morning. I definitely give them a five star rating.

Text: Super friendly and helpful staff! The whole place was clean and well taken care of. Our family of 6 stayed one night traveling across the country and this was a great stop. Kids enjoyed indoor pool area of course!
