Text: Lovely setting and appointments, generally well-prepared food in the restaurant. Rooms are a little small but very comfortable. Great location for people visiting the university or downtown locations.

Text: One of my top 5 restaurants I've ever eaten in.  From the house wine to the entree to the service(thanks Pagent). If you ever get to Lexington make a reservation you will not be disappointed.

Text: Beautiful early turn of the century hotel but with modern amenities. Stepping in to the lobby area takes you back in time with the decor. There is a very nice restaurant inside with great food and cocktails.
