SpringHill Suites by Marriott Chicago Bolingbrook
Rating: 5
Text: I have had a great experience at this hotel so far. The room was large and fairly clean. I really like the in room refrigerators and quality fitness equipment. The breakfast options were also much more plentiful than expected and more than at similar hotels (and included in the room rate). I would stay here again.

Text: First thing you'll notice is nice looking lobby 2nd thing will be the friendly staff. No super friendly..... like everyone that works here. Rooms are clean well laid out and a good size. 

The breakfast has lots of options and quality was good.

100%  would stay again if in area.

to the person that said rooms are small.... you're crazy.

Text: Springhill Suites is one if our go to hotels and the Bolingbrook location did not disappoint. Extra ling couch to relax and very clean room. A ceiling fan is a nice touch. The staff has been very friendly. Close to restaurants and stores. Will definitely be back.
