Courtyard by Marriott St. Louis Westport Plaza

Text: Clean, cozy, but spacious rooms. Plenty of drawer space and great sitting area. Balcony was nice to sit on when it was cool enough too. Beds were comfortable and the duvet was a nice weight. Shower got hot enough (I like them very hot) and the water pressure was nice and steady. The gym had a few pieces of equipment malfunctioning and that was frustrating. The Bistro was a great option. I got in from my flight and was able to just order there instead of searching around the vicinity for something. Morning oatmeal was also good.

Text: The hotel was nice and clean and I was met with staff that was nice and helpful. Be prepared to park by the entrance of your floor corridor. Not all floors connect to to the main bldg. Nice price too.
