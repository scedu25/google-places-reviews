Text: Wonderful place! Ample shade (if not too busy) at most sites. The shower house is clean and welcoming. The grounds are very large and there is a pond in the back! Nice place to just stroll around. Dry camping is awesome because it is set back from the main campground and really goes far back. If you want to be secluded that's the place to be. Also great because you don't hear anyone's generator. 

The best part about the place is the owners. They are very warm and welcoming, always willing to chat and give information. Was invited inside the home when coming up to pay. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. Not because it's necessarily dazzling, just a lot of things about it are good. Hard to find that when staying in as many RV parks as I do. Have stayed here twice so far and will definitely go back if in the area.
