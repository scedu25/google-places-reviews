Days Inn Ellis
Rating: 5
Text: This was an excellent choice!! We were heading towards hays and the night clerk looked up the prices for us. Turns out, it was way cheaper to stay in Ellis. Great staff, excellent location right of the highway, not crowded, very clean, pretty friendly, and good breakfast. I recommend this Days Inn to anyone passing through the area.

Text: Great price, very clean and comfy beds! Only thing I would recommend would be to have a microwave in the room. Besides that it was a great place to stay.

Text: Forgot to take any pictures, but we actually stayed here twice on our trip across the country.  We didn't hesitate to stay anywhere else.  The staff was friendly, rooms were extremely clean.  It had a small but sufficient workout room and the kids also loved the pool.  Breakfast was the standard fare, which featured lots of carbs with some hard boiled eggs as protein.  Probably one of the best Days Inns.

Text: On an weekend getaway with the family...I typically stay at Hilton properties. This was an adequate substitution. Inside the room was a little loud...essentially it lacked sufficient sound proofing..which is more or less expected for this particular chain. However, inside and outside the property was clean and quiet environment. Staff was polite, informative and professional. The rate was reasonable for the services provided. A decent price for a decent stay.

Text: The lady up front was great. We got in late and she was very helpful. We already had a reservation which was nice. The room was great and very quiet. Would stay again.
