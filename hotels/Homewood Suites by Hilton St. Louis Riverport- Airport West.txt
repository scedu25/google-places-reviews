Text: Staff has great customer service! We had a fairly large group staying here for our reunion. Hotel kitchen staff were courteous enough to keep the breakfast bar open a little longer to ensure everyone ate. The rooms were nice and clean as well. Our floor's housekeeping staff Keya always made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.

Text: It was a nice Homewood! The staff was very friendly and even housekeepers said hello. The location wasn't too far from where we needed to be and it was much quieter than the city center.

Text: Love this hotel.  Full kitchenette with pots and pans, cups, plates.  Some rooms have separate bedrooms.  Other rooms are just one big suite. Bath and toilet in separate room, sink, mirror and hair drier in open area. Quite space, great staff, guest accessible grill for outdoor cooking, average swimming pool, basketball court. Freshly remodeled. Don't hesitate.  You won't be sorry.

Text: Not as clean or as nice as other Homewood Suite locations I've stayed. There are nicer hotels in the area that are similarly priced and have on site restraunts and bars. Not much in the way of dining options near by this location and no room service available.

Text: Staff is super friendly and courteous. Quiet, comfortable place to stay. I've stayed here several times in the past year, and haven't found a reason to stop coming back.  I'll definitely stay here again.
