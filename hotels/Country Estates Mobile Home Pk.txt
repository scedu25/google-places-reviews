Text: First they changed owners call new owner's about our dog they said they would anex him in and accepted him then about 7 months later they said we had to get rid of him. When we confronted them over it they denied it. I really wish my son could have his dog back. Idk who I can talk with over this because my son is heart broken because he can't have his dog. Who doesn't bark or run free like other dogs in the taylor park. Please alow him to have his dog back he loves him and needs him. Please rethink your polocy on dogs. Don't let the few who don't follow the rules affect those who did.
