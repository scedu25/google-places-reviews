Text: I must say this place was nice to stay at. The rooms were spacious and well taken care of. The staff was absolutely phenomenal and helpful! We had an incident with another guest and they helped us every step of the way to get it cleared up. I would definitely stay here again!

Text: The staff and maid at this hotel are so nice and do what they can to make your stay pleasant. The continental breakfast had a nice variety of items to please everyone. We stayed two nights in the deluxe building in the 400 number rooms. Affordable price compared to others in the area.
