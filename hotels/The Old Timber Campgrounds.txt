The Old Timber Campgrounds
Rating: 1
Text: I will not be camping here ever again, nor would I recommend it to my worst enemy. The owners spy on you at night. Their dog, a yellow lab named Zeus, is allowed to run loose. He has charged at multiple people and acted as if he would bite them. The owners have rules that only apply to certain people. They sit up at their "store" all the time and gossip about anyone and everyone who passes by. They recieve very generous donations from many people and they are incredibly ungrateful. This is by far the worst campground I have ever stayed at.

Text: A very nice place. The lots are not like parking in a parking lot. You really feel like you are getting away. The owners Ed & Joy are very nice and helpful. It is beautiful and peaceful. You can keep your Yogi Bears, I'm staying here.
