Text: Excellent place. Beautiful, impeccably clean with its own atmosphere.The owner is very customer friendly and thoughtful.  House is beautifully decorated and rooms look like an eye candy. Breakfast includes very tasty bakery and fresh fruit. You can use the fridge where you will find juices and yogurts. You won't get anything close to this from any hotel chains nowadays. I traveled recently and even for much higher price hotel chains only offer you coffee.  I highly recommend it to everyone who happens to drive by or stay in Smith Center.

Text: Very friendly, helpful, accommodating host. The house is beautiful and decorated with lovely furniture and period clothing samples. There is a reception room with snacks available at all times and we were told repeatedly that food in the fridge was available for us as well. The rooms were comfortable and well equipped. There are bath robes and basic toiletries (think Suave shampoo /conditioner and a razor) in case you forgot your favorites from home. Lovely claw foot bathtubs! There is a business room and WiFi. There are a couple sitting rooms as well and also a piano. Each guest room has a framed picture of the fire escape plan next to which is a small flashlight. Lots of thought went in to making this a comfortable stay for visitors.
