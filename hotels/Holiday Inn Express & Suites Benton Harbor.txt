Text: The manager is excellent. Incredible customer service top down. Room was clean. The bedding clean and well,maintained. Bathroom clean with a surprising travel essentials. Tooth brushes (2) male and female brand name deodorant, sewing kit, q-tips and cotton ball. Tooth paste (Colgate).  Wow. We travel frequently this was a wonderful extra.  
In-door pool and a fitness room.  I would stay there again and recommend this Holiday Inn Express.

The only thing was I requested a play pen for my baby to sleep in which they said they would take to my room I never got it. Other then that it was a fine place to stay at.

Text: To start with the location is new, clean and has a great breakfast. However, that's not the real attraction. The staff here went above and beyond for us. We had to move our entire wedding party to this hotel after Springhill Suites gave up our rooms to extend the stay of other guests.

The manager, Kyle, bought a fire pit for our group so we'd have a place to hangout pre and post wedding (AMAZING: what hotel does that?). Kyle and Christine contacted our guests to let them know they'd been moved, even though it wasn't their responsibility, and they had nothing to do with Springhill's error. Charlotte helped us out during the day making sure any needs were met. Josh the night shift manager brought out warm cookies and milk for our party. 

Seriously folks, the staff here are fantastic. Out of the dozens of hotels we have stayed at none come close to beating this crew. Highly recommend staying here.
