Hilton Garden Inn Wooster

Text: The accommodations we're no better or worse than any other chain hotel. I stayed there because my daughter was playing in a softball tournament in Orrville, Ohio. There were approximately 70 teams in the tournament. That's a significant amount of people needing a place to stay. I feel the local hotels, which there weren't many took advantage of that fact. While many large chain hotels provide some sort of continental breakfast for guest, this hotel was charging 10.95 per adult for breakfast. Hotels were over priced in my opinion. It was 154.00 for a single night stay. It seems the few hotels in the area we're all offering almost the exact same rate and amenities. The tournament was great. The hotels took advantage of all the parents who brought their daughters here for the great tournament.
