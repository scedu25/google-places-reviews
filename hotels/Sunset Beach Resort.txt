Sunset Beach Resort

Text: Spent the weekend at this resort and loved it! Was right on the water with a sandy beach and they also have a very nice pool. The cabin was perfect for us. Has everything you need and more. The view was beautiful. The owners, Karen and Tom make you feel right at home and take very good care of their quests. We have already booked the same cabin for Labor Day weekend. Highly recommend this resort to anyone!

Text: This is a great little place to stay. We r n a 2 bedroom 1 bath unit. Only downside is right across the street from Backwater Jacks.... can be a little loud but A/C in the unit drowns out most of the outside noise. Decent beach area to swim in and pool is nice.
