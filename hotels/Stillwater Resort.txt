Text: Great rustic cabins that are clean and close to the water.   Each cabin is slightly different in configuration but all are clean with individual deck and outdoor grill.  Private boat launch is available as well as ample trailer parking.  Overnight boat dock storage is also available for a fee.  There is a community fire-pit for campfires.  The couple that take care of this place are great people.
