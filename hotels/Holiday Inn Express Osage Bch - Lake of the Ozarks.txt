Text: It's not the newest hotel, but the rooms are spacious and clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and remember your face from day today. The breakfast is perfectly adequate. The heat and air work well in the rooms. I would be glad to stay here again.

Text: We stayed 2 nights. Comfortable enough, I'd stay again. Getting in and out of the location is a little v tricky, there is a big bump to drive over. The hotel is on a hill and the lot is sloped. The 1st floor room was a bit musty smelling, but not bad. AC was powerful. Shower was strong. No refrigerator in the room, however. Breakfast was stocked and had good options.

Text: The curtains did not cover window real bummer. The coffee maker didn't work. Breakfast well they tired but save your money.

Text: Nice, cozy, quiet, updated hotel. Not 5 stars due to no fridge or microwave in the room. Otherwise, they had the nicest breakfast offerings I've seen at ANY other hotel. I was beyond impressed with it.

Text: I usually love Holiday Inn. This one was meh. Outdated...ac smelled...and my room was right next to exit door next to highway. Plus side...in fairness...breakfast was good...and they have sign remodeling starting 4th quarter 2017.
