SpringHill Suites by Marriott Lawrence

Text: As always breakfast was exceptional and the rooms were definitely above standard I stayed in the Queen double suite. The overall architecture does apply a nice sound dampning standard I didn't really hear any other guests. The staff were exceptionally helpful and gregarious.

Text: Its well located. Rooms are adequate. Never expect an upgrade regardless of status - youll never be offered it. Nice view of river easy walking distance to Mass ave which has great restaurants and bars. Reasonaby priced and mostly clean. Breakfast is generally well stocked.

Text: A nicely modeled hotel within an older, and large building. Unfortunately the day we spent their they were repairing the lobby A/C but had set massive cool air vents inside to cool guests. The staff were pleasant and informative. 

Our room was very clean. Everything was as expected as far as readiness. I do hope they update the bathroom in a future remodel.

Text: Very nice people, but the room was dusty. The ceiling texture was falling down from water damage, however this area was not visible unless a person was laying in bed. The mattress was not good, but I will admit that I do prefer a firm mattress. Overall the visit was not bad, the price for the room was comparable to hotels in the area. When these issues were addressed with the front desk upon check out, they were kind and professional and provided me with a 30% refund.
