Text: The room was affordable but I should of known. The room was not completely clean. There was a old as hot dog an cigarette ashes. Behind the lamp on the night stand. So the night Stand was never cleaned. Then there was something gross on the wall in the bathroom. The over night attendant did his best helping us out. He is awesome. But your cleaning staff sucks.

Text: Place is decent for the price. The room seemed clean. Bathroom was clean and the shower worked fine. It was hot when I stayed and the AC was okay, but wish it was colder. But it was still better than outside.

Text: The only good thing I can say was the beds were comfy and no bed bugs. Otherwise the shower was only a trickle of water, no shampoo, no coffee maker, chairs had stains, they don't t dust under the beds and dead roaches on the floor that luckily I had a wisk broom to sweep up cat litter from our 2 cats. I could go on but you get the idea.

They were very helpful.  They really made me feel important & the reason for their business!
