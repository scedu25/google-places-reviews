Text: Not too many horse camps provide the hospitality and a well-maintained facility that Midwest Trail Ride has. Jeff and Kim have been updating the facilities since taking ownership several years ago. Our family and friends come back every year. Nice stalls for the horses, roomy sites for trailers and comfortable cabins. The trails are convenient from the campground to the National Forest or Jeff provides a service to trailer the horse and rider to a distant trail head. What other campground provides this service? Thanks for the great times Jeff and Kim.
