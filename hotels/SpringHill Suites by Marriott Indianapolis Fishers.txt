Text: Pretty nice rooms with air conditioning. There is a divider between the bedroom and living room areas that I really appreciate. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The only complaint I have is that during the stay, there were bags of towels and carts of towels out in the hallway my entire stay (3 days). Typical continental breakfast which I have no complaints about, and I appreciate their store that allowed mw to buy contact solution when I forgot mine. I would definitely recommend to a friend.

Text: This is a wonderful and a common hotel. The rooms are well designed and equipped for the busy traveler or families on a trip. The staff is very friendly and helpful, breakfast is included, and they have a nice 10 person hot tub for when you need to relax.

Text: Great location. Very clean hotel. Room was beautiful and very large. Breakfast was great with many warm options. Pool was slightly cold would be the only downfall to this hotel.

Text: The room itself was very spacious, but I think that was because it's a wheelchair accessible room. The shower kept fluctuationing between hot and cold during my shower. Walls were extremely thin and I could easily hear my neighbor talking to someone.

Text: Nice, updated rooms with plenty of space. Staff is very nice, and it's a good location for local attractions, as well as the highway.
