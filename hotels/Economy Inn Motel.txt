Text: Clean and nice helpful staff. But the next two times I was to go there they tried to put a wheelchair bound person to go up and downstairs. So had to cancel my reservation.

Text: An older establishment, that is not very well kept... The room smelled of bleach, and most of the tiles in the restroom were loose or broken.

Text: It's not the greatest, but considering the fact that ONE single dude is running the entire thing (front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, and the whole nine yards) the place is in pretty good shape!
