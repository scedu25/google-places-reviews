Text: Always a good place at a good price. The only downfall was the shower. The shower didn't have a good shower head so water went everywhere but where you need it and couldn't get a good tempiture it was either too hot or too cold.

Text: Everything as expected.  Room clean.  Staff was very helpful checking in.  Guess I'm old,  price was in line and less than others in area but they all seemed too high.   I realize there is inflation over the yearss
