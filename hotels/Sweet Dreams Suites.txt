Sweet Dreams Suites

Text: Horrible, horrible room.  Room number not on door (it was above the door but didn't see it until daylight in the morning), phone didn't work, mold in bathroom, bed sagging, chair covering coming off, no dead bolt on door, coffee maker did not work and no coffee in lobby.  Would give it a minus star if I could.

Text: Bed bugs and cigarette burns in covers and carpets, staff that doesn't know the difference between full and queen size beds.  Hotel is filthy, old and should be completely renovated.  Any reviews stating otherwise are false.
