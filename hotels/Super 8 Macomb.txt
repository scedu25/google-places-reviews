Super 8 Macomb

Text: Rooms were clean and fairly priced. Would have given a much higher review but in the middle of the night we had to move rooms because our air and tv were not working. This is fine and the lady was nice about getting us a new room. Right after we moved rooms the front desk lady called us and told us to keep quiet that this was our last warning. We had not been loud before and had not been warned before. Obviously moving rooms is going to cause some noise. Also this non smoking hotel smelled terribly like marijuana. Enough so it gave us headaches.

Text: Easy check in and check out, clean rooms, comfy beds and very close to WIU dorms. Parking lot entrance is really steep though so watch out for your bumpers.
