Rating: 4
Text: Great breakfast spread with waffle makers, oatmeal, and healthy choices.  Quick access to I-74, and highways 24, 8, 116, Bradley University, Peoria Zoo, and downtown Peoria. Next door to the Levee District and Pair-a-dice Casino.  Caution, there are trains that come through this area all night if you are a light sleeper.

Text: Friendly staff and decent room. The bed was comfortable and continental breakfast was fine. The room had an annoying energy saving gadget that required inserting your room key in order to power (at least some of) the outlets, overhead lights, and lamps. The idea is that you can't leave the lights on when you leave since you need your key and removing your key turns off the lights.
