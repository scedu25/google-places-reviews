Text: We had a family event at the lodge, reserved a room in the dining hall (approximately 25 people). We arrived and there were dirty tables and people still eating in the room we reserved. We went through the buffet line for food and the wait staff was telling other guests they could sit in the room we reserved, ultimately forcing us to ask them to leave. The food was terrible. I would never go back to eat there again. We didn't stay overnight so I can't speak to the lodging part, but the food experience was terrible.

Text: Rooms were clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. A good mid range place to stay, I would recommend and stay here again.
