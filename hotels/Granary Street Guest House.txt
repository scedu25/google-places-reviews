Text: Perfect house for my parents and all of my bridesmaids to stay in for my wedding!! The house is beautiful, and the open kitchen and living room allowed plenty of space for spending time together and getting ready for the wedding. Robin was incredibly kind and helpful. I  would  happily  stay here again!
