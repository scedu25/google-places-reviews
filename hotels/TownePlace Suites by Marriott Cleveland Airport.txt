TownePlace Suites by Marriott Cleveland Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed during Halloween week while visiting family. Good value for the money. Desk staff helpful and courteous. Close to shopping, airport, dining and interstate. Fixtures showed age in wear and tear but cleanliness and good housekeeping helped make our stay comfortable. Would return.

Text: Great staff here. Every one is friendly. Rooms are clean and comfy. Breakfast leaves some room to be desired as they don't have fresh cut fruit and all the foods are the same every day. Would definitely stay here again as you can't really be picky about a free breakfast. Location is just a few miles from CLE Airport and they even have a free shuttle.

Text:  It's good. A little confusing on the entrance, love the suites but I don't like that food delivery can't come to the rooms. Can hotel rooms start putting night lights in their rooms? I always have to leave the bathroom light on!
