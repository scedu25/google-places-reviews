Text: After traveling 8 hours, we needed a place to stay for the night. We Price-Lined the Peoria area and came up with this hotel. It was a very pleasant surprise! We arrived at 12:30 am and check in was easy. The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The extra seating area with bar sink, refrigerator, and microwave were wonderful. The free breakfast was one of the best we have had in all of our travels around the country. We definitely got our money's worth at this hotel. It is a great place to stay! Highly recommend staying here.

Text: Delighted to stay here overnight. Room was large and comfortable. A little older furnishings but still comfortable. Staff was excellent and helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, hot and fresh. I will certainly stay here again in the future.

Text: Worst ever! The toilet above me leaked . I found out because it was on me. They did nothing except gave me dry towels. They said they knew there was a problem in 407 leaking into 307 but still put me in there. Couldn't give me another room because nothing was available.

Other reviews say how good their breakfast is. I don't understand their sausage was white. This place is disgusting.
