Text: Great experience from start to finish! Kathleen was very friendly when she took my reservation and remembered me days later when I checked in. The hotel seems clean and well cared for. I loved the separate bedroom layout! The breakfast was phenomenal with not one but two staff members keeping the area stocked and clean.  (A welcomed change from recent experiences at another "luxury" chain. ) It's not marble and porcelain but it is comfortable and family friendly.  Perfect base for our family when we visit our near by college student!

Text: Nice place, quiet with a really good breakfast. Beds come with feather pillows which I'm allergic to so called to get some cotton ones. They weren't best pillows, pretty flat, but beat sneezing. Price was fine and overall would recommend it.

Text: Pool, free cookies, great breakfast, comfy beds, clean, nice staff. Room vaguely smelled like cigarettes? And the curtains don't close, only the sheers.

Text: I was there attending an event and the staff was very friendly, the location a little far out and when we took a tour of the rooms they seemed very small. The pool area is spacious and they have an exercise room all located on the main floor. They also have a guest laundry. The design and layout is very nice and unique. If the rooms were a bit larger it would be at the top of list and had received full stars.

Text: Nice hotel. Comfortable beds, great guest services and employees, all are very friendly and helpful. Free breakfast is pretty good, and no matter where you seem to go in the hotel, there's a bowl of candies...almost like being at grandma's ;) Movie theater and restaurants/bars nearby as well.
