Text: Great service, the front desk people are amazing especially Lou Tufano. The rooms are well-maintained recently rehabilitated and have soothing  colors and really nice couches lots of room as they had Studios and Suites I've stayed in both. Definitely worth staying at Great location.

Text: Friendly & efficient staff. We had the two bedroom, two bathroom suite which was perfect for our group of four. Breakfast was busy but as should be expected close to checkout on a Sunday. Will stay again next time we're in town for Ravinia.

Text: As soon as I got there, I got sick with a really bad cold. I called the front desk to find out if they had orange juice and a bottle of water anywhere and Lou, the front desk person said that it was right there at the lobby. I asked if there was room service and he said no and that he could have come at the moment because he was the only one at the front period And I said okay nevermind I'll try to make it over there. As I'm getting dressed to go to the front desk, I hear a knock on my door, it was Lou, he brought me two big bottles of water, two containers of orange juice
