Text: The lady working the desk was just wonderful.   Very helpful.   We ended up getting a smoking room instead of non.  Room was very large & clean.   However they are in the midst of remodeling. It was still dark outside when they started on the room across from ours.    For the price it's ok.

Text: We've been here 3 weeks, working for KU.  Great staff. Convenient to the Casino, Warsaw or Vevay. It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but I'd stay here again. Our room was clean and no complaints.

Text: Staff was friendly.  The room was clean.  The beds were extremely uncomfortable.  It was like laying on box springs and the pillows seemed nonexistent. For a stop over it did the job, but you get what you pay for.
