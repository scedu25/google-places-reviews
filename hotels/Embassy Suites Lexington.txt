Embassy Suites Lexington
Rating: 5
Text: I was working as a DJ for a wedding here. The first thing to say, is the staff was amazing. There was a delay with the previous group, so I wasn't able to get in the room until really close to the start time. The staff was Incredibly helpful in making sure I had what I needed. On top of that, the facilities were absolutely gorgeous. This is a great place, and I look forward to coming back.

Text: Nice hotel, clean and we'll appointed. Happy hour drinks are great, food however is lacking (if one has to suffer this is certainly my preference). The place is starting to show it's age however and really needs some update (the carpets would be a good place to start) hence the Los of a star.

Text: Very nice hotel, and not pretentious in any way. This is one of the larger Embassy Suites we have stayed at. The lobby has nice fountains, and a daily happy hour with complimentary drinks and snacks. The room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.

Text: We had a KAC convention this weekend and they picked a great hotel to host it. Rooms are nice and bigger than anywhere I've stayed before. The hotel came with complimentary breakfast that was great. I'm fact each meal we have eat here has been great. I would definitely suggest anyone I know to stay here of visiting Lexington.

Text: i did not stay here. I attended a meeting but the service was great. The food was so good for appetizer type food and it was beautiful. Embassy suites are hands down my favorite chain to stay in.
