Text: Courteous staff.  Great amenities.  Nice clean rooms.  Unfortunately, missed out on the continental breakfast because of an early flight but great little coffee, tea, hot chocolate bar available all the time.  Would definitely come here again.

Text: Conveniently located near Interstate 80. Friendly staff. Very clean. Love the interior decor update since our last visit en route to Colorado. Same time, same place for the last 6 years! We'll be back in 2 weeks on our return home.

Text: Great stay. Wished the garbage bags were larger (kept falling into the can).  Weird thing, there isn't any guest laundry onsite. No biggie. Room was awesome. They gave us the room we requested. Great value. Will be our hotel of choice when we visit the QC again.

Text: Very clean inside the lobby.  Room was nice and clean, and the beds/pillows were very comfortable.  Breakfast was included with lots of options.  Would recommend and would stay here again.

Text: The overall stay is what I expected in a Hampton Inn. The hotel in Moline was one of the nicest ones. Definitely book this stay!
