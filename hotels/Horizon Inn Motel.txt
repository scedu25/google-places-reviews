Horizon Inn Motel
Rating: 4
Text: I chose the Horizon Inn primarily because of the rate. The staff was very courteous and pleasant. The my room was clean and comfortable. I think the only negative to my stay was that the pillows could stand to be replaced. The bed although a bit firm for my liking, was clean and comfortable to sleep in. If you're looking for some place that's wallet friendly and not high end but very clean, this is the place. I would easily stay here again and recommend the Horizon Inn to anyone.

Text: We were taking a trip with our family and we needed a place to spend the night. We booked Horizon based on other people's reviews. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We had a problem with our first room and even though they were very booked, they helped accommodate us. The owner went out of his way to help us, even though he had family visiting. The rooms were clean and there is definitely value for money staying at Horizon Inn.

Text: The desk clerk was great in getting us a ground floor room, ad I couldnt go up stairs very well.  The room was clean and newly remodeled.  The bathroom fixtures need to be updated.  The hotel was very quiet and we got a great night sleep.  The air conditioner was already on when we arrived and room was very comfortable as temp outside was 100.  Manager was very helpful and very nice. We would definately stay here again.

Text: Good value for price. Friendly owner who has made many upgrades and cared about our comfort and satisfaction. On I-80, a quick drive downtown.

Text: The Horizon In Motel was conveniently located just 10 minutes from our concert venue (Pinnacle Arena), and is fortunate enough to have a gas station immediately adjacent to it. While small, the rooms were clean and sheets appeared to have been laundered. The pillows were rather stiff, but not so uncomfortable that one wouldn't be able to fall asleep. The TV, shower, and vanity areas all worked as intended with no complaints. The service was friendly and the cost was quite reasonable (I believe we only paid $60 for an overnight stay). You will need to put down a $50 security deposit upon checking in, so as to insure the hotel against the use of any smoke-products in the room by the guests. This deposit will be given back to you upon checkout and an quick inspection of the room by the manager. Breakfast consisted of cereal, make-your-own waffles, juice, coffee, milk, and bagels. Everything but the juice was up to par with typical motel food; that is to say, it was quite edible. Unfortunately, the juice was rather watery and unappetizing. Overall, considering the price, the Horizon Inn Motel serves it's intended function and is not unclean or unfavorable, as one might expect a motel to be when priced so reasonably. I would gladly stay here again.
