Lincoln Suites
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed here 2 years ago and had to stay again this year. The rooms are large and have lots of outlets, which is nice for those who travel with electronics. The walls are all made of wood and even after the years it's been open it has a nice wood smell. The breakfast is good with biscuits and gravy, eggs, a meat, cereal, and a few other options. Definitely recommend if you're in the area

Text: The hot water barely warm, free breakfast not good. I hope you like muffins and fresh fruit. They make you pay all room charges in advance (when you arrive for your stay).

Text: Water pressure in shower not so good. DON'T let them put u in the rooms right next to the office. It sounds like a herd of elephants going up and down stairs. No coffee or tea water after breakfast is over. Just too noisy. And DON'T go to Sam's steakhouse . Try the 2 local restaurant s downtown off the 1.

Text: I almost skipped this place looking for a name brand. I'm so glad I didn't! Nice, clean, lots of smiles from the staff made my stay a pleasure! Will certainly stay again when in the area!
