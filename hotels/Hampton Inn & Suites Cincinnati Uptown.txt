Text: Absolutely awesome staff! Our TV remote wasn't working and just for that, they upgraded us to the best suite available. Everyone that works here is very friendly. The building is very clean throughout. I felt safe staying here. I would highly recommend staying  here for your visit

Text: The hotel was fine. It was nice having a mini store right near the front desk for forgotten items. The room was clean. We were a little disappointed that the pool wasn't heated, it was a bit chilly. Overall not a bad stay

Text: 3rd floor king bed with fridge and couch was spacious and clean. Price was good. Bed was not very comfortable. Not enough cushion over the inner springs.

Text: Very nice , clean hotel near university of Cincinnati campus.  Very good breakfast in the morningy.  Staff very friendly, only negative is the toilet in our room ran about every 5 minutes due to leaky flapper in tank.

Text: Clean, modern hotel. They overbooked and upgraded us to a suite room at no extra charge. They had a nice pack n play for our 1 year old to sleep in that had sufficient padding and a fitted sheet. Our room was also quiet and did not hear other guests around us. I do wish the parking was cheaper and not open to the public though. There's no guarantee that a spot will be available for you to use since it is shared by the public.
