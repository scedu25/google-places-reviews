Text: Top notch service!!! Dillion and Sherri were fantastic. They went above and beyond to ensure our stay for the eclipse was amazing. They even went as far as providing solar shades for our family. We loved to service and WILL be back. Thanks for the hospitality! Eclipse 8-21-17!! A stay we will always remember!

Text: Nice hotel, I was a bit concerned about the location so close to the highway, but the rooms had excellent glass and you could not hear that hwy noise at all.

Great rooms, beds were nice.
 Pool left a bit to be desired.

Text: Having family in Columbia we typically stay with family however this trip we decided to stay here. First off I have to say the experience was very good. Our room was very spacious and well laid out. The beds were clean and comfortable. Our room had 2 Queen sized bed and a sofa that would fold out to make a 3rd Queen sized bed. The morning breakfast was also top notch with eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, cereal and waffles available as well as fresh fruits. Our stay was excellent and we will definitely return to the hotel next time we come to see family.
