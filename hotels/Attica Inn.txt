Text: If you're looking for a place to stay that allows dogs, don't come here. The owner is strict with noise concerns and will call your room if he hears your dog bark. Otherwise, an okay place. Bathrooms are clean and there's nice air conditioning. Beds are pretty decent.

Text: Not at all the type of hotel/motel I'm used to staying in. Place smelled like curry and room was kinda musty. Beds we're hard n you could hear the springs popping when you moved. Sheets were clean and bathroom was clean. Great water pressure. I searched the room for bed bugs and I think it was all clear. Although I still left my suitcase outside when I got home and I've discovered a few red bumps that itch on my skin. I'm praying it's from mosquitos from being in the woods at Badlands. Owner accent was very hard to understand and I work with Indian doctors every day. Overall it was a ok place to stay considering there's nothing else in town.

Text: Your average small town hotel. No breakfast, no outdoor seating, nothing within walking distance. Clean place for stay.
