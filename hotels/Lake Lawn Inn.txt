Text: Good price for a good sized room with 2 beds that are actually soft compared to most motels and the comforters are soft also unlike those weird feeling ones we expect. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the pool was down, but we weren't planning to swim anyway.

Text: I stayed here on a business trip and was pulling a large trailer so was first of all pleased to see that there was ample flat parking.  The lady who checked me was most pleasant and helpful when I asked about restaurants and coffee in the morning.  They have no breakfast but had a nice two cup coffee maker in the room.  The motel is the older ma/pa style and is owned by Americans who have had it for years.  The furnishings were pretty old, but the room was very clean  and neat and every thing worked so I was pleased with the room. The bed was clean and comfortable.  I would go back as it was economical and well worth it.

Text: We stayed at motel while mother was in hospital.  Room was in mid 70.00 price range. After we settled into room we realized there was no cable at all and there was no air conditioning. Tried to call office repeatedly and phone just rang and rang.so the next morning we asked why we paid 70 plus dollars for a room with no tv or air. Response was well the ac guy was supposed to be here couple days ago and no one had tv last night. They offered no discount or any type of refund. Will not be going back!
