Text: The staff is great. Clean clean clean. I have worked on many hotels and stayed at hundreds and this place along with a few others from this same organization is great to say the least.

Text: Stayed the weekend for a friends graduation from college. Hotel was clean, and pretty nice. The location isn't to bad either, especially if you're going to Worlds or Oceans of Fun. The beds we had are comfortable, and the rooms are quiet. The only gripe I'd have is that they don't have a breakfast, but that's not a deal breaker for me as I usually skip it. It'd just be nice if I had my kids with me. Overall I'd definitely stay here again.

Text: Kind of a mess, actually. Took them three tries to get my parents into their room. The first two my parents were given keys to rooms already reserved by other guests. Consider the security implications of a hotel that will hand out keys to your room to others. The shower in our room did not work. They fixed the shower the next day, but our first day we had to go to different rooms to take our showers (and the whole process delayed our morning departure).

Text: Perfectly fine location to get around KC.  Exactly what you would expect from a Candlewood Suites.  Right across from Worlds of Fun.  Was here on business and expected large loud parties of families and kids because of WOF.  However, i did not really hear a peep.  I would stay and recommend.
