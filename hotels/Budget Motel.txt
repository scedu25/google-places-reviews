Budget Motel

Text: The worst motel I've ever stayed in. Smells like smoke in the room, the walls are full of smoke! It stinks so bad I can't stand it!!! The Windows do not open either!!

Text: Far from great.  Very strong odor in the office and we were given a smoking room without being asked if we wanted non-smoking.  Very unclean, not even clean towels.  Thankfully sheets seemed decent, stayed just long enough to sleep then get back on the road.
