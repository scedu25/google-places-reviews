Text: The rooms are very nice. Lives up to normal expectations. Lobby has coffee, assorted teas, and hot chocolate all the time. Free breakfast is great. Waffles, eggs, sausage, etc. My door is hard to get into. It gets stuck, but that's not the case with every room.

Text: Great rooms and breakfast! Weren't in there long and didn't need much service so can't really rate on that.
