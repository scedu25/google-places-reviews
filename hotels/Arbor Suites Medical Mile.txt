Text: I spent 2 nights here. Quite pleasantly surprised by how well furnished the room was. New and stylish. Very good hot breakfast with a lot of variety. Friendly and responsive staff. Amazing value for the price which was the cheapest in the area to boot. Best "2 star" (?) I've ever stayed at. Two thumbs up!

Text: We loved our stay here. The room was clean, the beds comfortable and the kitchenette very helpful. Breakfast in the main building was nice with options for cereal, muffins, eggs, sausages, fresh waffles and more. We will definitely be back!

Text: I booked on Priceline and was under the impression I was booking at the location near the mall.  So I'm bumbed out that we got stuck off near the highway.  I'm not sure who's to blame for that.  

Hotel wise the place is good.  Breakfast was free and the area it clean.  The hotel room is nice and was very clean when we arrived.  All of the staff has been very polite.  I'd recommend staying to anyone. Just make sure if you want a specific location you verify.

Text: The room was awesome  !!! However,  they gave me 2 bottles of shampoo and no creme rinse. Not knowing this until after I was in the shower and washing my long hair, did not make me happy. I packed in such a hurry,  I had forgotten mine, unfortunately.  So, other than that,  the room was very nice. They even gave me a discount because my niece was in the hospital across the way. That was very thoughtful of them helping out with our expenses in our time of need . Thank you for your thoughtfulness.  I would definitely stay here again.  Hopefully under different circumstances.
