Hampton Inn & Suites Ft. Wayne-North

Text: Our experience with this hotel was nothing short of amazing!  After driving for  12 hours we were completely exhausted when looking for a hotel.  The nearby hotels had terrible customer service and were very rude.  We were on our honeymoon and had already been in the car for 12 hours before deciding to stop. Patrick at the front desk was one of the best people we've ever encountered at a hotel front desk. He was so patient and caring.  He was so happy to help us and gave us a phenomenal room!  We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family and anybody that we know traveling and hope to see Patrick again!

Text: I just spent the last 15 minutes on a phone call in order to set up a reservation at this hotel. I feel like it should be a lot easier than that.

Text: Our stay was very short and we spent only a bit of time in the hotel. Everything was lovely, the staff were friendly and super helpful. The room was so much more than we needed for the stay and felt quite swanky. The breakfast was great, as usual. Hampton Inn' s suites are rapidly becoming my favorite go-to for traveling needs!
