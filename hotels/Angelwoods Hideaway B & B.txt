Text: What a wonderful time we had at Angel Woods Hide-a-Way!!! 
The home is beautiful & decorated so lovely.  The hostess is just a doll. So warm & friendly & she is the best cook around!!! 
I stayed in the Teddy Bear room.  It has a private bathroom with jacuzzi tub. Plus it has access to a great deck that overlooks the gardens & pool. 
The bed was comfortable & I slept so good.  Woke up each morning to great coffee & yummy breakfast.  Love the poppyseed blueberry muffins!!! 
We were there for a craft retreat and all of us just had a wonderful time. So much so we plan on coming back again next year.   
I highly recommend this B&B.

Text: We went to Angel Woods for our Christmas dinner, did not stay over night. Our hosts were very warm and welcoming and the house is very cozy. We had a great dinner- soup, salad, bread, chicken, potatoes, and the best brownie for dessert. I've considered staying overnight here for an in town getaway, and now it's at the top of my list for my next B&B stay.

Text: What an amazing anniversary-Valentines stay we had at the Angelwoods Hideaway. The price was a great value and she added a military discount on top of it.
First, she made us breakfast, snacks, appetizers and 3 course meal which was better than any restaurant around. 
Second the atmosphere just boasts romance and relaxation. In the morning we relaxed in the hot tub inside our room with the fireplace going. Later in the day we soaked in the outdoor hot tub overlooking the woods as the snow lightly came down. 
Lastly, the service was second to none. They went above and beyond with their hospitality. They were friendly and accomodating in every aspect of our stay. We are definately going to be one of their "regulars."
