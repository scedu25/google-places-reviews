Text: We were at the attached Hoofman House Banquet facility for a wedding reception. The staff was both welcoming and humble. The space was very large and well kept. I had concerns that there would be a fair amount of public foot traffic being a hotel, but the room was at the end of a hallway, far from hotel guests. We had a wonderful time, and i would absolutely recommend this place to others

Text: Quiet and nice. And I mean quiet! My room shared a wall with the elevator lobby on my floor and I never heard a thing. Slept great in the nicely appointed without being lavish room. Hotel has attached restaurant and bar and is very close to everyday-type shopping.

Text: Good hotel busy area.  If you like the ability to have everything around you.  This is the place.  Shopping, food, bars, entertainment.  It's all here on state St.  If your like me and like a quieter place, you might want to head down the road a bit..

Text: We were told we were getting two kings but they were definitely doubles. The rooms have obviously not been updated in a little while and things like the shower colors and the wallpaper don't match if that's something that matters to you. Staff was very friendly and helpful and the location was right next to the highway. Overall the experience was just fine.
