Baymont Inn & Suites Peoria
Rating: 4
Text: Husband and I stayed here over Labor Day weekend. Definitely had issues with malfunctioning door that kept us out of our room 2 out of 4 nights. That was frustrating, however the staff was phenomenal from manager, front desk, maintenance, housekeeping, to the breakfast attendant Dee. Very warm, helpful, and accommodating. Bed very comfortable, great tasting coffee, warm tasty breakfast (much better than many higher priced chains), clean, warm well maintained pool. They do a good job with this older property. We will definitely come back to Baymont Hotel. In my hotel experiences, I have never met a kindier or more friendly staff. Keep up the good work!

Text: Very helpful staff, clean and comfortable. Hot scrambled eggs n sausage, biscuits and gravy along with standard rolls, cereal, apples, refrigerated items for breakfast. Staff and or manager accompanied me to my room when there was trouble with the key. I mentioned any early flight out and the night staff said he will have fresh coffee at 4:30AM for me. The room was well kept and they did not intrude on my sleep. EVERYTHING worked as it should. In room coffee maker and coffee 24/7. Pool n fitness equipment.
