Text: Location great! But customer service was AWFUL! I stayed in room 125 I wake up during the middle of the night to a bed but crawling near my face. Was moved to room 229, everything was fine. Checked out both attendant and manager were previously told about my complaint. But were very persistent that I had no proof (when I have a picture) I thought they were rude. Wouldn't recommend hotel as far as their BEDBUG problem!!

Text: If you want a quiet place to get some dedicated writing or work done, this would be an ideal location. It is fairly quiet, clean and there is a mini-fridge and microwave in the room. Some things need to be updated but it is effective. Be sure to hide your things when you leave the room just in case housekeeping comes into the room clean up when you are gone.

Text: For under 70$ per night this was great a motel for a stop over. Five stars if tub drain worked properly.  Free breakfast was average for low price motel.   Our room was clean, quiet with adequate linens, towels and supplies.  This is an older two story motel, all rooms exit to parking lot or common deck way.  The are no elevators so second floor guests lug everything up steps.

Text: The rooms could be cleaner and in a better shape. The location is fine if you are traveling by car. The breakfast is pretty basic. Overall, it's fine for the price.

Text: Other than a little paint peeling on the bathroom ceiling, everything has been great for the price. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I even enjoyed the continental breakfast
