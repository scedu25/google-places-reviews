Text: We stayed there last weekend.  Our site was 95 and is a good size.  Very enjoyable couple run the campground.   The pizza was great,  shower and bath house were clean.   This is our second time and we will definately be back!

Text: Everything is clean and convenient. Staff are helpful and friendly. Close to interstate so not quiet, but not too loud either. I would have stayed longer had I known how nice this place was.

Text: We've stayed a a number of campgrounds on our recent trip.   This one would be rated as one of the best.   Nice staff, beautiful surroundings, and lots of space.  Campsites are a little tight, but very workable.
