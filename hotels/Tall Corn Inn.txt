Text: Love this place...we have stayed here multiple times when we visit my brother in law and have always had clean and awesome service..our Mom had passed away and the funeral is here in Shenandoah Iowa and the owners made sure that we had accommodations to make things easier for us...the rooms are designed out from the 50's and 60's motif...we stay in the Elvis room...clean , large with everything you need to be comfortable including the beds and bedding. We have stayed at downtown hotel and it was nice ...but the service and caring attitude we have gotten here was above a beyond...not to mention the prices were awesome. If you want a great place to stay that's clean,good service,Breakfast and large rooms that have all that is needed I.e. microwave , refrigerator and much more then this is the place to stay..
