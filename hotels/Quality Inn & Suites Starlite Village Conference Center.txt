Text: This used to be a nice hotel but has definitely gone downhill! The lack of water pressure was unbelievable, not even enough to rinse the shampoo out of your hair nor flush the toilet. Very noisy as well. Breakfast selection is okay at best but the number of employee's children/family (and it appeared to be a few friends) far outnumbered the paying guests. We stay 1 if not 2 nights for every home football game plus numerous nights throughout the year and definitely will not be returning to this hotel!

Text: It was ok. My wife and I haven't slept in a full sized bed in several years, it was cozy. I wish they had full sized pillows. Maybe they do, but I didn't ask to see if they did.

Text: Quality hotel for comfort and cleanliness.  Great restaurant attached to the motel.  Staff very friendly and courteous.  Room was clean and comfortable, although the sink area was a bit on the small size for two people to put their personal items.  Would stay here again when in the area.

Text: Quality Inn, Ames Iowa, entire staff, even with an exceptionally late check in, extremely friendly. Sabr Hanna's smile & friendly chit chat on check out made the up and coming cold Grey road of the day of travel a little warmer

Text: Room was nice. Pool was only 3ft and very small. Very bad insulation for noise. Loud doors and hallways. Middle of the night was very loud and front desk didn't do much.
