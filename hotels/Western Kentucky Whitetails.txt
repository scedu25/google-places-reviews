Western Kentucky Whitetails
Rating: 5
Text: Hunting at Western Kentucky Whitetails was a experience of a lifetime.  I thoroughly enjoyed my hunting trip. I had a fantastic guide that guided me in the right direction. I got to stay at the very nice lodge and enjoyed a awesome homemade meal that was provided for me. I did leave with the biggest buck of my lifetime that I enjoy looking at everyday in my home. Everyone should take a hunting trip at least once with Western Kentucky Whitetails and you will want to go back. Thanks Bobby and Amy Taylor for a awesome hunt!!!
