Text: Great hotel. Lots of friendly staff. Rooms are clean and spacious. Free breakfast and a managers reception in the evening. Many bars and restaurants within walking distance. Hurts donuts across the parking lot is great as well.

Text: This place was absolutely awful. We planned on staying here for my sisters birthday. We were in our room talking amongst ourselves  and was told that we were being 'too loud' in our room. She was very rude and then told us that she was calling the cops. We had to leave at 2:00 in the morning, literally while we were sleeping. And drove 2 hours home. We were not being loud what so ever, talking in the room that we paid for. The people were awful and ruined my sister's birthday. We will NOT be going back.

Text: The Room we stayed in was very clean. The pool was nice I always love going in and outside from the pool. All the food was VERY good. The shop they had was a cute idea but was kind of expensive but that is to be expected. The hotel was right by Hurts Doughnuts which is very convenient. So my stay was pretty good!
