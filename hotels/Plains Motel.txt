Plains Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Good value. Older building but kept up, roomy and clean. Half the price of the other motel in town and we don't need a pool anyway.
Rating: 4
Text: Just a simple hotel. Nothing fancy. A shower and bed. Very friendly owners. Wifi.

Text: Quite dated, but clean.  Mattress is fine - I like 'em solid.  Pillows...well, there's something that could be improved there in a major way.  Have stayed at the Rodeway a block or two away before.  It's fine.  But the bathroom at the Plains is gigantic compared to the Rodeway.  Had a nice conversation with the owner and her granddaughter.  Holdrege is my hometown, so I will no doubt stay here again at some point in the future.

Text: Internet is fast. Staff was nice, and helpful. The rooms are dated, beds are hard and the room smells old. But if you need a quick affordable stay this is the place.
