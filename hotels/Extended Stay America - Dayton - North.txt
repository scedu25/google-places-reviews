Extended Stay America - Dayton - North

Text: Really nice hotel for the price! Staff wasn't at the front desk when I arrived, I had to yell hello. The room was really nice and spacious but the toilet seat was dirty with brown stuff. The sink seemed to have a bit of cleaning supplies in it. The ceiling fan didn't work and the light by the closet flickered while on.

Text: Nice location with lots of restaurants and close to the highway. Grab and go breakfast was just that, no where to sit, but we all found something we liked. Room had nice furniture and was clean. It was nice to have a full size fridge and kitchen area. Although there was an issue with our fridge and freezer, so it wasn't cold until morning. The bed was fine and there was a nice leather (I think) recliner in the king room. Overall good stay for one night.

Text: This place is top notch!   Great staff always eager to please the customer.  The rooms are squeaky clean.   Last night I walked into a perfectly clean room with a slight hint of fresh paint.  Bed was awesome as well.

Text: The broken A/C ruined it for me and my friend staying here. The hot and muggy Dayton summers make having no A/C borderline miserable. The saving graces for this place are the large rooms and micro kitchen. It's also the first time I've ever been to a hotel that only has housekeeping come once a week. I would take off points for that but it seems that it's normal for an "extended stay" hotel like this. Decided to update an extra star for the customer service. The lady at the front desk was very nice this morning.

Text: Great location - surrounded by 20 restaurants. Room is fairly clean, no shampoo or hangars provided. Free internet is pretty slow. Kitchen in all rooms with pots and pans available upon request.
