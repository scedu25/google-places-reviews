Castaway Bay
Rating: 5
Text: The staff was awesome! Room was clean, and well maintained. The water park was the very best part of this vacation! Cedar Point may have been a bust, but Castaway Bay is incredible! Ask for Rashid, he definitely went out of his way to make our stay excellent. If I could give more than 5 ?'s, I would!

Text: Stayed here more than once and the assistant in club castaway was very cool and pleasant! He actually engaged himself in being a kid and engaging in dancing and singing! I loved his manners and his personality! Finally found a person good for club castaway! :) I think his name was Leandre!

Text: Convenience to park, 4 stars. Anything else, 1 star. Cleanliness, service, 1 star. The beds in the room had been made but sheets not cleaned. Floors not cleaned. Room is spacious and small balcony is cool. Beds & pillows not comfy at all. The water park is actually ok. Several slides were not working though. Breakfast not worth $. Convenience to the next door restaurant is good. That's about it. Maid service needs to be dramatically improved! Just getting a clean room would bring it up to a three star. I travel and stay in hotels over 200 nights a year. For an independent hotel, this hotel needs to really CLEAN to stand out!

Text: Very nice hotel with an indoor water park, definitely had a good time. The sheets on one of the beds was not changed though, we found nasty food stains and even some crusted food on the sheets and blanket. Luckily they store extra sheets and blankets in the room so we were all set on that. Other than that no real complaints.

Text: It was 4 out of 5 stars. I wish there was a last river and a funnel slide but other than that. I had a blast.
