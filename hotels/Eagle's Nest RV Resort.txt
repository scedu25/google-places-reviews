Text: I had to write this review!  We pulled in after the Downhams and they couldn't be more wrong!  This is the best park in the Truman Lake area!  Not sure why they thought they could stay here for only $100/month when the rate is $350/month?!? They complained about everything and expected special pricing for some reason!?! Then they gave them a bad review.  Don't believe them!  The park is mostly a yearly park and is currently full with a waiting list - the people we talked to love it here!!

Text: We stayed one night instead of the three months that we wanted because it's overpriced and all the owners think about is money. The park is looking worse every time we see it with high weeds, ruts in the road and the spaces need some new gravel. We stayed at this park for almost 10 years and it's been going downhill ever since.  If you don't believe me then go see for yourself.
