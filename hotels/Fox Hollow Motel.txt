Text: 3-night stay was very pleasant!  Extremely clean, quiet, comfortable.  Nice patio for visiting with friends.  Booked 5 rooms for family & friends.  All agreed on the quality stay we had.  And the prices were so reasonable!  Thank you Al & Pam!

Text: Pleasant surprise considering it's a bit in the middle of no where so when we arrived I wasn't sure what to expect and now I know that EVERY SINGLE TIME I will be passing/staying in Nebraska I will stay at the Fox Hollow. So clean and nothing like a small family business taking care of you. You can really feel the care and warm hospitality they bring the the table! Thank you for the wonderful stay we loved it!!
