Text: Wow! I eat a vegan diet and came in for a business conference in one of their meeting rooms. They provided us all lunch, but what really surprised me was that they went out of their way to provide me a vegan meal of fruit and a black bean burger from the restaurant across the street! True customer service right here!

Text: I am SO happy we stayed at Wild wood! For the price we paid and the entire hotel, it was a steal. The lobby was so welcoming and cozy. The rooms were beautiful, clean, super comfortable. The even the indoor pool carried the same charm with a waterfall from the spa to pool. The breakfast was incredible. Fresh scrambled eggs she made right next to us. I cannot say enough good things. It wasn't just a regular hotel that you stop for a night when passing through, it was a true destination. If I ever go through Des Moines, I will definitely stay here again!!

Text: Clean room. Comfy bed. Well equipped room. Under construction while I was there. Fire pit out front. Took a little bit for the water to heat up in the shower.
