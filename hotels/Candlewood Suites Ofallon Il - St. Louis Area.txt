Text: A bit hard to find, even with GPS - no clear signage at, around, or near hotel until you were practically in front of it. Front desk person was not very welcoming and made was they thought were funny comments, when in fact they were just rude. It didn't help in the first place that he demanded ID, like we were criminals or looking to hide out. He also made a point of telling my husband in a snarky tone that he looked much better now compared to his ID picture, and upon handing us the room keys, told us to "go read the signs" with a shooing motion to find our room. Hardly ever looked up and sure never smiled, nor did he get up from his stool. He also spent a great deal of time telling us what was not offered in ameneties, such as ice machines and pool, because they focused more on "extended business type stays." Room itself was small and sounded like water was running almost 80% of the time, even though we could never figure out how. Air conditioning panel hung on its hinges and there were clumps of exposed wires underneath. Roll out chair to desk was covered in black sticky substance rendering it unusable. All in all, would not stay here again.
