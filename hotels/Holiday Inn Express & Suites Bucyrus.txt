Holiday Inn Express & Suites Bucyrus
Rating: 3
Text: Stayed here after a wedding reception. Hotel is kind of hard to get to with no clearly marked road access at night time. Other issue was parking, several of us had to park along the curb with no spots available. Positive things were the staff was friendly, I had a very basic but nice and clean room, and breakfast was decent for the room price. Nothing great, nothing bad. Just a typical, normal hotel experience. I really did love the Kuerig coffee maker in my room, that was a nice convenience.

Text: Over all experience was pleasant. Room was a little dirty. Caulk in bathroom was moldy corners of floor cracked and crumbling. Sink caulk had mold\mildew. Breakfast was great for a hotel continental. Rooms were quiet and conveniently located. Drive into hotel was extremely poorly marked and awkward to navigate and locate.

Text: Room was what you expect. Plenty of pillows and sheets. Also had a microwave and refrigerator. Shower was disappointing with very little water pressure and hot water that lasted 5 minutes. This was at 8pm. Breakfast was decent. Bagels, cereal, pancake maker. Also had sausage, biscuits, sausage gravy, and scrambled eggs. If you're staying in Bucyrus, this is your best option.

Text: Great reasonably priced hotel in the middle of nowhere. No luxury, but rooms a clean, nicely furnished and everything is well maintained. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.

Text: The stay was good. We were in town for a wedding and the hotel was in a perfect location for it. When we arrived, our room smelled like smoke because I believe someone had smoked in the room earlier. They offered an air freshener for the trouble. Although it wasn't ideal, they did place two rollaway beds in our room at request which was a huge help to us as the hotel was full and needed to sleep a few more people. Overall, great stay and would stay again.
