Text: KEEP GOING! BED BUGS!! 
My family members just stayed there and there are BED BUGS. I saw them for myself. The owners were told with no offer of money back and no apologies. My family had to head back home a day early because of this. They were miserable. 
Something seriously needs done with this place. It is a dirty and run down place to stay. I would not even put a dog in this hotel.
Fix it up, get rid of the bed bugs, get new beds and I'll rewrite my review. Until then, people, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.

Text: It was a nice place to sleep a night. Greatest thing was the service. We drove three hours from our home for a event today. Something went wrong with payment down the street and this place helped us out with what we had in our pockets. Will go back to this hotel anytime we come to Indiana.

Text: The new owners are all about making a buck. They over booked and turned multiple people away that already had reservations. Outdated and dirty. The pool was closed due to "cleaning " but the "cleaners" family were sure enjoying it. They own the hotel on the hill across the road and told my children for $50 they could use the Jacuzzi over there. Never again!

Text: This motel was very clean, affordable,  had a friendly staff, and was in a quiet location.  The room had a microwave,  refrigerator,  and hair dryer. I would stay here again.
