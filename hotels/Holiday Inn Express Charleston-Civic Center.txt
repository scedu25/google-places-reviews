Holiday Inn Express Charleston-Civic Center
Rating: 5
Text: This was a nice hotel right in downtown Charleston, WV. It's clean and accessible to everything in the city. The staff was very helpful and checked us right in. The wifi worked great and the rooms are clean and comfortable. There were plenty of places to eat nearby. The parking lot was large and well lit and we got a good parking spot to load in. There was a microwave and fridge in the room and all of the carpet was new and modern. This would be a good hotel whether you're traveling through for business or with a family.

Text: The staff at this holiday in are amazing and compassionate.  They treat their guests as family and truly care how each visit has been. They also care about the well being and comfort of each guest.  I felt as though they were my family. Benny and James in the buffet area, Dan and the front desk personnel, and housekeeping staff were all amazing.  Management was very courteous and professional.  Just an all amazing experience.

Text: The interior was pretty, and the staff were great. For what we paid we should have had a fridge and hot water. There was a huge hole in the bathroom wall where an access panel should have been and no stopper for the tub. At $145 a night we expected the basics. Next year we'll stay somewhat else.

Text: It was fine. They have complimentary toothpaste/toothbrush as I was stranded in town for the night. Gave suggestions on shopping which is a short walk to the mall. My room was near the elevator was my only complaint(noise).
