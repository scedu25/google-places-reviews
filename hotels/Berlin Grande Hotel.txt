Text: Great!  Room was spacious, comfortable & very clean.  The complimentary breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed scrambled eggs, bacon, Belgium waffles, fresh fruit coffee & juice but there were a number of other choices. Staff was friendly & helpful. Would definitely go back & recommend to others.

Text: It is a clean, modern hotel with many amenities including indoor pool and exercise room. Breakfast is free and the offerings each day were really good. Parking is free and easy. Free cable TV was nice, too. No password for WiFi, free access.

Text: The hotel is beautiful, with great views of the surrounding countryside. If you're visiting the area, this is a solid choice if you're looking for a hotel. The rooms tend to book quickly, so you'll probably need to plan ahead

Text: The rooms are excellent and very well maintained. The service has been caring and involved. We stayed for four nights and we were treated as special quests. Looks like there are many improvements coming. Extra rooms and extra services. Highly recommend Berlin Grande Hotel for a base in Amish country.
