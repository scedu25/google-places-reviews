Text: Great service ladies at the front desk. They were fantastic! The continental breakfast options here are great! Really enjoyed and appreciated the extra yard they go with breakfast. As far as I could tell the smoking rooms and non-smoking rooms were intermixed. Once in the room you could tell though. The worst part of the stay were the pillows. All of them were extremely flat and lumpy. Overall, it was a pretty good place to stay.

Text: If you need smoke free I wouldn't stay here. The smoking rooms and non smoking are all intermingled.  Requested non smoking. Said it was so I believed them, But, it was smoking. When I called desk to switch they said they booked last room already so I don't have a choice. The saddest part is I used my points for a free stay, really disappointed for that reason :( it seems clean and comfortable. Just don't like the smoking mix up.

Text: Not too bad.  The motel was in an older building and needed some upgrade.  Seemed clean but had a general musty odor when you walked in front door.  Our room was a non smoking room but still had a faint smokey smell.
Staff were very friendly breakfast was good.

Text: My wife and I were driving from Chicago to Las Vegas and needed a place to stay for the night. Super friendly staff. Clean, modern, comfortable rooms at a very affordable price. Their continental breakfast went above and beyond, waffles and biscuits and gravy among the other normal things. Set me up well for a long day of driving.

Text: Great price, nice comfortable rooms, very friendly staff. The beds are good quality, sheets are soft, and the pillows are great. There is a really cute espresso place, Lasso Espresso a short walk for a great cup of joe. Highly recommend.
