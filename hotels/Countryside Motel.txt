Text: What a sweet little place! I stayed at the Countryside Inn with a couple friends, and we couldn't have been more pleased. The rooms are fairly small, with only one bed a piece, but they are air conditioned and nicely decorated. 

Bathrooms are showers only, but quite adequate otherwise; there are also no phones in the rooms, but we all had cell phones, so that was no big deal. All the rooms have TVs.

NOTE: The address listed on Google is NOT correct! The Countryside Inn is located at 405 E Penn Ave, on the eastern side of US-67. That caused us a bit of confusion coming in at night. :)

Overall, I loved this place--it was sweet, relaxing, and the owners were very nice and helpful. I would absolutely recommend the Countryside Inn to anyone who isn't too hung up on having a lot of "frills" with their stay. Totally worth the price!

Text: We just stayed here during a family wedding. We were very pleased, the room was small, but decorated with very loving country charm..it had a homey atmosphere. The lady who checked us in was very sweet and gracious.
Bring your own drink...you have to walk about 1/2 a block to a pop machine next door (or at least that was only beverage we could locate later in night)..or you can get water from the bathroom sink.
Our room had a Queen Bed with nice sheets , quilt and matteress.
There is a T.V. & Chair..no phone.
We will stay there again ..price was more than reasonable.
We would recommend trying this motel if you are ever near Roseville, IL.
