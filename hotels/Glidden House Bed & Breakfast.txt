Text: Despite other snarky reviews you may have read, Glidden House is a wonderful stay.  My wife and I stay there whenever we're in town and enjoy it immensely.  The breakfast is a treat and Clarice and Gary are wonderful and accomodating hosts.  It's not the Four Seasons, but it's the best in West Central Iowa.  Enjoy !
