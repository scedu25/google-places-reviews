Text: This was an extremely nice hotel situated in a beautiful area. The restaurant located inside of the hotel was fantastic. I had food and drinks and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend someone staying there in the future.

Text: This was a nice hotel, convenient to lots of shopping and restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable and tastefully decorated. I didn't use the pool and hot tub, but it's there if you want it! There is a covered drop off/pick up driveway which was so helpful on the rainy weekend we visited. 
My only complaint is that the front desk service was somewhat lacking a few separate times throughout our visit. Upon checkout, there simply wasn't anyone around, so we eventually just left.

Text: Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Staff was very helpful and nice. Restaurant inside for dinner was great and the bartender was very friendly! Their breakfast buffet was also very tasty! Definitely would recommend staying here if you're in the area and will definitely stay here again if we find yourself in the area!

Text: I had lunch at Johnny's Italian Steakhouse. It was amazing as always. Never had a bad meal there. Consistently great. Thursday lunch special is steak. Get it!
