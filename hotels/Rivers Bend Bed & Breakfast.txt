Text: My fiancé and I stayed here last summer and just loved our time. Rita was wonderful and the location was perfect. The rooms and common spaces were absolutely charming. And wow! The breakfast was sensational. Rita can really whip up a breakfast and she was so sweet to let us leave with some of her homemade jam. It brought back memories for a long time! Thank you Rita.
