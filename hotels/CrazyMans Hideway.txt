Text: Highly recommend this place for any event, wedding, graduation party.  The staff was great. The shed they use for the event was recently rentavated and looks amazing. Also the house that you can rent for your event is truely exstonishing.  Both building have a country cabin feel to it.    If this house and land were on the market I surely would try to buy it.

Text: Absolutely Horrible....The owner harassed one of the guests at my daughters wedding reception so badly that a number of guests left. He continued to harass my guest even when I asked him to leave him alone....he ruined the experience for myself and several guests . The property is beautiful...the owner is a rude ignorant pig...I regret that he got paid...I would never recommend it to anyone.The guest was harassed because he is a Stock Broker.
