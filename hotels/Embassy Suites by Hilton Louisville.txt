Text: Clean. Friendly. Great staff. Bar/restaurant has great food and service. Bed is comfortable. A/C unit is not a window unit which was super great for me due to breathing issues I was able to breathe comfortably. Highly recommended!

Text: Superb! This hotel was recommended by a friend and for good reason, I have zero complaints. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean and welcoming. The room was spacious and was designed to optimize the space. The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. The breakfast was by far the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. They have a chef cooking to order omelets and pancakes. The chef was very friendly and entertaining. The location has a lot to offer. They are close to multiple restaurants, shopping complexes, bar scenes, and more. It was the perfect place for our weekend get away. High recommend!

Text: The hotel offered guests free drinks the evening we checked in and that was a great start to our evening. The room was clean and the amenities we're great. The hotel is close to a great shopping area which was enjoyable to explore. Breakfast was nice with an omelette bar and everything. The staff is polite and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again myself.

In the evening, the hotel offers free drinks and appetizers and a full, made to order breakfast in the morning. Good location, about 15 minutes from the airport. Pillows are a little too soft but the bed is comfy.
