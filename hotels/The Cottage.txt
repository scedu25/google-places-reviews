The Cottage

Text: The Cottage is a beautiful retreat!  I had the honor of spending an evening there with my aunt while on a trip from Wyoming.  The atmosphere is like a mental massage, it soothes from head to toe.  The interior of The Cottage and all of the tree houses are decorated beautifully, attention and care is put into every detail. I can't wait to go back!  This is the perfect place for a romantic getaway, a sister-trip, a private getaway with just yourself and book... I can think of a lot of reasons to go visit!  The owners are some of the greatest people you could ever hope to meet, too.  Don't hesitate booking your stay, you won't regret it!

Text: Beautiful, fun, exciting! This is perfect for a getaway weekend. They do gift cards as well so this could be a fun place for a gift for someone and then have them pick the date to go!

Text: We had a great stay in our treehouse. The treehouse was very cute and fun and the breakfast was amazing! The hosts are very friendly and welcoming. If you are looking for a memorable time in Hermann, this is the place to stay.

Text: A delightful change from an ordinary overnight stay. Beautiful surroundings, comfortable accommodations, great breakfast, very close to downtown. The loft ladder is a little intimidating but totally safe. Great fun in the Sunrise treehouse!

Text: Dined here with a wedding party after rehearsal. The location is a little off the main path, but easy to find. Food was decent and wines from local winery were served. Staff was pleasant and building was clean
