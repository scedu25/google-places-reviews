Text: Adequate room with a king size bed. I was greeted by a pleasant front desk clerk. I was a bit disappointed that there was not a fridge in the room. I called to ask if they had portable ones and was told one would be placed in my room the following day while I was working, but no one showed up. The rate seemed high for the area, but I did not compare to confirm if it was this specific hotel or if the entire area is over priced. Overall, I'd probably stay here again since it's on an expense account, but I'm not sure if I would if I was paying on my own.

Text: Staff was fine just what you expect however this hotel needs a major renovation, rooms look like they haven't been touched since the early 90s, lights flicker and aren't bright. Furniture are old and outdated but get the job done. The bathroom shower doesn't even drain when showering, I was disappointed with the quality of the room I will not recommend staying here I rather go to the holiday Inn if I have to stay in Jackson.

Text: Was visiting from Florida for a graduation and called on the way. Chase helped us and was tremendous. Every member of the staff, including the young lady that works overnight on the weekends and the manager Kirsten, went out of the way to make our stay a pleasurable one. Our room was extremely clean, as was the rest of the hotel. Wish i could give more than 5 stars... Definitely recommend for anyone staying in Jackson MI.
