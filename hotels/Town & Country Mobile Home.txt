Text: I have rented from Dave for over 5 years now.  I consider Dave Compton to be a top notch person and landlord.  He and his crew are there almost immediately when you need repairs.  A brand new trailer at the edge of campus at $550 a month in a very quiet park is the best quality living space for the money that I could find in this area.  Highly recommended.

Text: The one star is mandatory if I want to write a review on Compton, that being said I never had a roach problem until I moved into a unit of theirs. They entered my unit unannounced, anytime they wanted. Once I was out of town, again they entered unannounced ultimately leaving my unit completely unlocked for four days. Wasps had their entrance into my unit as well, by way of an opening on the body of the trailer itself. An old stove that produced dangerous levels of carbon monoxide anytime the oven was used that instead of replacing (Carbondale Fire Department can testify to this) told Dave Compton "Just replace it, it's outlived it's use. And then if you approach Dave Compton about an issue regarding your unit, you might even get his common reply of "I am busy, you have 8 seconds...what do you want"? His maintenance men share the same attitude as Dave Compton himself. Save yourself the money, and grief and go elsewhere.
