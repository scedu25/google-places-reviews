Bearcat Getaway
Rating: 5
Text: Our large group from Peoria, IL had their annual Float Trip Weekend here for at least 12-15 years. I made 7 in a row & had an absolute blast every time. The Campground is beautiful, the beach is clean & the water is clear & fresh. The Staff is very cool & the amenities are pretty decent considering you're in the middle of the woods. Great Bands during the Busy Season on a large stage. It's definitely a good place for families as well as the rowdy groups like ours. Very affordable too: our trip was $55 for the float & the weekend camping.

Text: This place is wonderful! The river is beautiful, the camp sites are taken care of, the concerts are free and the firewood is included. The late "light's out" time is perfect for people who want to enjoy themselves with friends late at night.

Text: We called a month in a half in advance and reserved our camping spots and put down a deposit and we called to finalize our reservations and we were told that they didn't have enough spots for our group so we had to cancel and they kept some of our deposit. This was their fault but we had to pay. We will never deal with these people again.

Text: Stayed here last three years for several days at a time. I have been a vendor here for the weekend music in the rv park. Want to do your thing. Then this is the place. Cool office staff. Basic rv park on the Black  River.
