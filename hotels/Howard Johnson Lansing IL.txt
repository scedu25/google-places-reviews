Text: I stayed for a week and the deal was phenomenal. The housekeeping very friendly, nothing else I remember carrying in his work car all purple, I could not ask his name but he is very kind. I left my room and it was very nice and everything in order. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. Excellent work staff very unfortunate that today was my last day.

Text: Only 2 towels. No wash cloths  Old furniture, broken . Needs serious remodeling.  Poor Customer service.  The maid knocked on my door at 10am when check out is at 11. It has become a hotel for transients and strong smelling marijuana smokers. Also people banging on the door across the hall arguing with the occupants.  This hotel has really gone down since they begin to offer weekly rates.

Text: I waited about 10 - 15 mins. For someone to come to the front desk so l could get checked in. The phone in the room does not work. The toliet does not flush correctly and the water drips in the tub. Must leave your id at the front desk to use the iron and board. The breakfast consist of coffee, bagels, and mini muffins. There is cold cereal and a microwave to warm the water for the oatmeal. The hotel is being updated and is clean.
