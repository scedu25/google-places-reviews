Super 8 Marion
Rating: 4
Text: Great for people with pets. Hotel staff are very accommodating and friendly, to humans and dogs alike. Location is convenient. Rooms are somewhat updated, but nothing fancy. The hotel overall is kind of dated. No pool. Stairs to the upper floors. Overall it's pretty good for the price and the pet friendliness.

Text: This super 8 @ 2601 Vernell Rd.. Has been absolutely awesome.. I stayed the night of the 4Th and again last night (the 8Th).. 
On the 4Th my daughter left her boots in the room,  I called and they had them and held them for us.. I checked in last night and needed a room with a rollaway bed and the woman was very accommodating,  she moved our room to the one with the extra bed.. 
Their continental breakfast is awesome.. They have waffles, danish, toast, cereal, juice, and coffee.. The ladies thay work here go above and beyond to take care of their guests.. 
If you are ever in need of a place to rest your head this is it.. Rooms are spotless, beds are super comfy.. 
The ladies I dealt with are Ms. Pam & Ms. Connie.. 
Come on and visit, they treat you like family!!!!!

Text: Newer, very clean and comfortable rooms. Breakfast bar well stocked. Staff very helpful. Reduced star rating due to lack of elevator. I liked the added security cameras in the hallways. No complaints, will definitely stay here again.

Text: Clean room with everything we needed for a driving break with kids. They provided a pack n play for our infant which made packing so much easier. Breakfast also had lots of options for the whole family and plenty of it.
