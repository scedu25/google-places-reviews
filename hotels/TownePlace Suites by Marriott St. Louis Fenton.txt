Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were great. They have a nice kitchenette and suite area. Location is good as it's within 20 minutes of the airport. The service was good and the front desk staff was friendly.

Text: The location is a bit off the beaten path, but once you get here once it is easy enough to find. The check-in was super smooth. There was a minor issue with the bathroom door, but after alerting the staff it was resolved before we returned to our room in the evening. Breakfast options include hot food and cold foods, with some healthy options. The queen studio was a nice size, with a decent kitchen (plates, utensils, etc included). Stayed for three nights.

Text: Amazing staff!!! The latenight worker was so nice to me. Oh my gosh! Definitely made everything go so smooth during my stay! Thank you Mr.Cyril! The room was also very nice! The a/c can be turned down very low. The bathroom didn't have a vent fan tho.

Text: The staff has been very friendly! The room I booked for a family of four had one queen bed and a sofa bed. We were pretty snug and the sofa bed was not particularly comfortable. Overall a good stay, but the sleeping arrangements need adjusting.
