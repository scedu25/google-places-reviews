Text: Clean and nice rooms. Free breakfast at the attached Fat Bottom Bettie's restaurant which becomes a bar with good pizza at night. Quiet rooms due to being up from the highway. Great staff. As nice as a Holiday Inn Express. See photos...

Text: The hotel was very clean and very accommodating. All the rooms and hallways smelled fresh and the bathrooms were very clean. We had a mini fridge and microwave in our standard room, which is always a nice plus. Overall very nice stay, would definitely reserve rooms here again.

Text: Walking in, the desk staff was very friendly. The lobby looks very modern and updated. The rooms were large and very clean. The bathroom had a large shower and double sinks which was great for getting ready. The room needed a little updating. I would definitely stay there again.
