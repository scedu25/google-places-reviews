Redbud Estates

Text: I rented from Red Bud Estates  for a year and a half and do not have enough great things to say about the managers.  I would call or email with an issue and by the time I would get home from work it would be fixed.  They were always willing to help out and did whatever I needed.  And the rent was very reasonable!  I would move back in a heartbeat if I could.

Text: They sold us a house as is but didn't mention  the a.c. or furnace didn't work. They play favorites with the tenants. Incredibly rude & not worth the time I put into it. They'll get the lot back just the way I found it. A mud hole.
