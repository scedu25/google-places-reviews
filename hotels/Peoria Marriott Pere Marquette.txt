Peoria Marriott Pere Marquette
Rating: 2
Text: Location was nice if interested in downtown area. Lobby was pretty. Valet was very cheap but unbelievably slow... call them 10 minutes in advance at the minimum. Main issue is my baby and I stuck on elevator for 15+ minutes. The call button didn't work. Alarm button had no response. Eventually I had a friend drive here to get hotel staff to free me and I was made to feel like a nuisance to them. Very surprised with no apology or empathy as I had a 7 month old with me in a very small elevator which didn't even have an emergency option... pretty inexcusable.

Text: I am a high status Marriott member spending many nights/year in Marriott properties. I would not recommend this location. . My room had been smoked in  despite that all Marriots are smoke free. The hotel needs a good cleaning and the concierge club breakfast is lacking and the manager was rarely in the club when we were there on a Friday morning. This hotel is in a renovated building in downtown Peoria.

Text: My school was staying at this hotel for the IRC. I have seen Myles Davis at the front desk helping numerous people, asking if they would like help carrying things. He even asked us if we needed help bringing our bags in. He is beyond helpful and a very nice person! Very impressed. The room service was also very helpful and impressive. I will return in the future due to the wonderful help here.

Text: Great place, awesome service and friendly staff. Table 19 restaurant has Fine Dining along with great service. The ballrooms are very elegant and perfect for upscale celebrations.

Text: The hotel is clean and very quiet, probably not the best place to bring children. The staff was very kind and helpful. The hotel is an easy walk from the riverfront where there are a few restaurants, museums, and a couple of shops. Overall, it was a great experience and if recommend it to others.
