Text: I ended up stay here for two weeks with 6 people everyone was sick with lung infections i know i saw black mold intghe showers. Dont bring an xbox when i left the cockroaches had infested my xbox. I have little bumps all over me im pretty sure that they had bed bugs or fleas. Either way live in hotels and motel's all over the country rhis was my worst expierence yet.

Text: Great for the drunks considering it's right next to a bar. Inside the room is best described as a really cheap hourly motel with a monthly rate of $800

Text: I end up going to the hospital because I was itching and broke out all over. Not sure if it was something I was allergic to or bed bugs!
