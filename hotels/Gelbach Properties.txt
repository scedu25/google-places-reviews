Text: Recently we were first time guests at the Gelbach Bed & Breakfast; we had the most wonderful experience.  The décor is beautiful and the place is pristine.  The breakfast that Rhonda prepared is something that a breakfast lover can only dream about.  Doug and Rhonda not only make you feel at home, they make you feel like you have been lifelong friends.  We had the most amazing and gratifying weekend at the Gelbach Bed & Breakfast.

Text: Horrible landlord. Always rude when being spoken to about problems with the apt. Landlord has problems with getting back to her residents after problems occur so maintenance comes by without warning. Unscheduled visits occur 3-4 times a week near the end of the school year. Would not respond back after asking when the new renters we're moving in, so my stuff was still in the apt when they wanted to clean. She then threatened to fine me with copious amounts of money if items were not removed from the house asap. Will never rent from this person, and don't recommend anyone else to either.

Text: This place is wonderful. Beautiful little town, unprecedented service, and great rates. Will stay again if need arises without looking else where.

Text: Not very nice. Made us feel like a burden & very poor maintenance of the building we stayed in. I'd give zero stars if it were possible! !
