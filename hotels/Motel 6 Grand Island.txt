Text: Spotlessly clean. Very comfortable. Only thing missing is the in room coffee maker, won't let that keep me away, I will stay here again. Thank you for making our trip so comfy, we appreciate you (staff is very customer oriente).

Text: The personnel were excellent.  Friendly, welcoming, making us glad we came.  There was not the sense that we are the poor who cannot afford the costlier motels (we can) but we are considered important because we are there.  We are equal...thank you!  Responded quickly to our needs/wants.

Text: This Motel 6 is directly off I-80, so a great location to stop while passing through Nebraska.  There is a huge truck stop across the parking lot with several food options.  You can even get a tattoo there if you want!  :)  
The room was quiet and comfortable.  I mainly chose the hotel because it is dog friendly.  There was some good outdoor space for dog walking.  The only negative I have is there was no shampoo or other amenities like that.  Friendly staff, coffee in lobby.

Text: Upon walking into the lobby, I was immediately impressed!!! Very modern and clean. Then I entered my room, again very modern, clean and not what I expected!!! I can remember going to the Motel 6 as a youngster and it was a cheap motel. But now it's an inexpensive modern motel, that I would recommend to anyone traveling. I used to avoid Motel 6s like the plague but, now I have downloaded the app and will be seeking one out when a have some downtime and wanna a break from the sleeper in the truck. Great Job Motel 6!!!!!

Text: As motel 6's go this is actually a really nice one...room was clean...coffee in the lobby was ready in the morning...staff was very friendly and the plus for people with moving trucks or semi truck drivers is there is a very large lot for these vehicles....
