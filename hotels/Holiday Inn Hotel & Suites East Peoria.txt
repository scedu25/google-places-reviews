Rating: 5
Text: Nice location. Clean, comfortable, modern rooms. The attached steak restaurant is great, though pricy. Free shuttle to anywhere downtown, and walking distance of a few restaurants. Great place to stay for the week.

Text: Very nice hotel and hotel staff. Rooms are very clean and modern and there are a lot of plugs. Airport van was late and they gave us free drink coupons for the hassle. Great customer service.

Text: Great hotel. Rooms are very vlean (a 'thing' of mine), staff always courteous and polite and a nice ambience about the whole hotel in general. Partnered with Johnny's Italian Restaurant to provide the catering, giving a unique and upmarket experience all round.
