Text: I stay at this Hampton whenever I'm in town. It's clean, the beds are comfortable, quiet.  Great for business as internet works well and you don't find that everywhere you go.

Text: Very clean.  Good beds. Friendly staff. Only drawback was breakfast, hot choice needs to have a no meat option other than oatmeal.  Each day of our stay, the eggs had ham in them.  Cook scrambled eggs with the meats on the side, or st least have that option.  Other than our stay was too short, great stay!

Text: Been here before with no issues but last night staying here was very loud. Had to work very early and hallways and rooms were very loud from guest. Walked out the main door and there was a large group of folks smoking and drinking outside the lobby door. This didn't bother me but I would think it might intimidate others. The rate was $140 a night which I thought was very high since the last month I was here was $129.
