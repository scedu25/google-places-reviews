Goodland KOA
Rating: 5
Text: Smaller campsite with a good location near i70. Can be difficult to locate at night. The showers were nice and clean with good water pressure and  nice shower heads along with shower caddies in each one. Each site has a nice picnic bench and pad along with a green area between sites. They don't pack you in on top of each other. This place is only open in the spring to fall. I would recommend this location.
