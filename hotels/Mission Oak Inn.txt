Text: My husband and I spent two wonderful evenings at Mission Oak Inn this past weekend. It was a wonderful get away. We asked for the picnic basket on our first evening and it was ready an waiting in our room after our long drive. The basket was just a hint of how wonderful the food would be the following mornings. We had planned to drive to a movie and dinner but instead chose to take several walks on the beautiful grounds. Over breakfast we heard several interesting stories of the inn's beginnings and their travels. Denny and Jan couldn't have been better company. We would definitely revisit Mission Oak Inn.

Text: After years of visiting this place, my mother- and father-in-law finally talked my husband and I into spending a few days here. From the moment we drove up, I fell in love with the place. The landscaping and architecture of the house was very well done! The inside of the house was absolutely gorgeous, the kitchen being my absolute favorite aspect! The room we stayed in was called the Bird Lovers Suite, with wonderful views of their private lake from the porch. Despite the rain and cold conditions, I had a wonderful time fishing with my husband which is a rare occurrence for me. My mother-in-law and I even visited the next town over during our stay which is a cute little town called Lacon. Such history there. I highly recommend this place; the innkeepers are a wonderful couple who are very welcoming. I would not hesitate to visit again.
