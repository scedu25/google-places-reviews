Augusta Wine Country Inn B&B
Rating: 5
Text: We spend time at Augusta Wine Country Inn whenever we come through Augusta (and we live in Wisconsin). Kathryn is so wonderful and the rooms are quaint. Not to mention the food! If you try it once, you may want to make it part of your routine travel as well!

Text: Six of us stayed at the Wine Country Inn B & B for a girls spa weekend. Everything was perfect, from the warm friendly welcome, comfortable beds, large balcony to the amazing breakfast. 
We started the weekend with a private yoga session and one hour massages at Halcyon spa. Followed up by lunch at Montelle Winery, antiquing and shopping in Augusta, checked into the B&B, visiting on the balcony, dinner at Balducci's Winery and a celebration champagne toast back at the balcony. 
We hope to make this an annual trip and Augusta Wine Country Inn B&B will definitely be a part of it.
