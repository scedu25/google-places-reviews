Americas Best Value Inn - Louisville

Text: Would NEVER stay here again! The "manager" is the most rudest person I've ever met! She was acting like there was no other rooms available when I told her that our AC wouldn't work... She came to my room and said "it is working mam" but yet we all woke up in  puddle's of sweat! I know that there was other rooms because I checked on the website and there were tons of rooms available. Not to mention there were maybe 6 cars in the parking lot. My suggestion for anyone that wants a nice hotel to stay in...don't stay here!

Text: The manager is kind and friendly, accommodating me and giving me the best value and rate possible. I think it's an excellent price with quality service. Free continental breakfast, clean rooms, kid friendly, and the staff make you feel right at home. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: The woman at the front desk was quite helpful and warm, also efficient. We checked in with no difficulties. The amenities were very adequate, and provided a good night's rest. The breakfast was nice, the only downside being no tea.

Text: Stayed one night, my girlfriend was stabbed outside the front door of the hotel as we were staying and the manager said because it was outside its not her problem them smiled and later told us to leave because of it then refused our deposit because she claimed her trashcan that was right there in the open was missing. I would never recommended this hotel to ANYONE get a MOTEL do not stay here, the rooms are disgusting from the start and the manager is lazy and repulsive attitude towards guests.
