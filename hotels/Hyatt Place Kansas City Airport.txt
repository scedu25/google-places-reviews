Hyatt Place Kansas City Airport
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms were nice.  Staff were all very helpful.   Was not fond of the breakfast bar.  Hotel bar was nice.  Very unhappy pool was already closed for the season with temps well over 90.  Would absolutely stay again!

Text: This Hyatt Place is great! Slightly older than others you might notice some age spots (lack of wall control panel for a/c) in the room but nothing that is a problem. Kind and prompt staff, great breakfast and a bar in the lobby - pretty much perfection in a middle range hotel. Itis also worth joining the loyalty program as I have always found reservations $10-30 cheaper than advertised online. Overall I recommend it.

Text: This is an old property and needs remodeling.Our room smelled moldy, probably from carpet and a/c system. However, the bed was good and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was good. The nightly rate was about twice what it was worth.

Text: This is a great hotel with easy access from I-29. The rooms are clean and well appointed. So, what gives with the 2 star rating? My car was broken into. Turns out this is a common occurrence at this hotel. The rate of thefts is so high guest deserve an additional warning. The hotel does not have cameras and has no plans to put them up despite weekly thefts. Stay here at your own peril.

Text: We had a good experience here. The people who worked there were nice, and everything was clean. Breakfast wasn't half bad either. The beds weren't the most comfortable, but not the worst.
