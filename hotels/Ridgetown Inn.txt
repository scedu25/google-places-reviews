Text: Nice stay and Friendly Staff.  I enjoyed being out here as it was convenient and they had the basic family necessities; fridge, microwave, comfortable beds and lots of tv channels.  The kids really enjoyed the pool and the racquetball courts. It was nice to be in the small town feel but right off of the highway.  Nice rooms!

Text: Staff was nice. Room was clean but very musty smelling. I coughed and sneezed all night because of it being so musty. The whole place need to be updated!! Toilet ran constantly unless i shook the handle. The breakfast is for such a short time i ended up missing it. The fridge in the room didn't even keep my orange juice cold for the morning and it smelled really bad too. This whole place needs an overhaul!! Definitely not worth the money i spend to sleep there 1 night!!

Text: This place should be closed down in my opinion ...they only pay their employees 2 and 3 dollars an hour. The water quality is not always up to standards. Poor customer service from the owners .satellite TV is down half the time...same with the Internet. Place is run down with trash everywhere outside. The pool chemicals are not always correct yet they allow people to swim in unsafe conditions anyway. They allow staff to work there and enter customer rooms without any police background check.

Text: I would very highly recommend that you do not stay at this motel. They have terrible service. The reception at the front desk need to wear a bra. They need use a ash tray instead of a beee can. They also need to not give there customers sass. The rooms are very disgusting and there was hair on my pillow gross, the pool is green and garbage everywhere. All in all, whatever you do, do not stay here. (0 stars).
