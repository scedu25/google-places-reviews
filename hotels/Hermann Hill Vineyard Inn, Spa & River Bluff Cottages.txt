Text: This is truly the top of the line of any Bed and Breakfast we have stayed in.  Pure luxury all the way.  The large staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The view is amazing especially at night with the sparkling lights.  Breakfast is over the top.    Upon arrival we were welcomed with a tray if cheese, bread and wine.  At bedtime a tray is brought to the room with coffee/tea, a candle, ice cream and two delicious individual cakes.  We have been here 3 times and can't say enough about it.

Text: The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating, everything about our room and view was picturesque and beautiful. We hadn't been to the town before but the host was a wealth of information and gave us lots info on the town. The room had TWO jacuzzi tubs too. I surprised my wife with a visit here and we both loved it.
