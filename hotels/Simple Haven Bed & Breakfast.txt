Simple Haven Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Simple Haven is a cozy and charming haven. The proprietors are congenial and breakfast is a delight. The many gathering areas, including at least three outdoor spots, are beautifully furnished with antiques and art. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we highly recommend it.

Text: Simple Haven is a beautiful gem just 2 miles from I-70. If you find yourself traveling central Kansas, Susan and Joe offer outstanding hospitality to everyone in a lovely small town, Wilson.  What a respite on a long drive to or from Colorado!  Delicious breakfast, easy interstate access, delightful conversation in a book-filled, cozy home with every amenity. Susan is a foodie with great tidbits about farmers markets throughout Kansas. You won't find more welcoming hosts.  Stop by and rejuvenate.

Text: There are times in your life when you come across people that have a true gift for hospitality and we found that in the Simple Haven B&B. Owners Susan and Joe made our stay one my entire family will remember with such happiness. Every room felt like you were staying at home, so much personality and warmth. The breakfast served will be one we will talk about for years to come...we only left Susan a blueberry in the fruit bowl!! That is saying volumes considering we are all foodies!!
We are all looking forward to our next stay...we may just make it a tradition!!
If you have a chance to stay with Susan and Joe, you will find it a true blessing!

Text: My wife and I stayed this last weekend there and what a great place! The Hostess Susan and her husband Joe were very welcoming and great fun to be around! The house was very quiet and very comfortable. We had the King bed and it was great!! 
I have to warn that the food was very good!! So be careful that you don't eat to much!! (And I might add laugh to much being around Susan! She really is quite a bundle of fun!) We will be back!!
