Text: This hotel is wonderful. The staff is friendly, kind and attentive. I was there for a family emergency and they made sure to make me as comfortable as possible. The entire staff was welcoming and caring. A special thank you to the GM and the Front Office Manager, who went above and beyond. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again.

Text: The rooms are great, with comfy beds, a refrigerator and a nice shower, however don't expect to buy anything in the little store without waiting for a very long time. After finishing with a guest at the desk the employee assisted five guests who called or walked up after me without saying a word to me but kept glancing over to see if I was still there. After fifteen minutes I simply left without my purchase and she didn't acknowledge me, even though there was no other guest and she wasn't on the phone. It faster and less of headache (even when you have a headache) to go to the Wood Dale Target.

Text: Had breakfast here for a business meeting. Nothing special with the breakfast buffet. Hot eggs, bacon and sausage. There were also some pastries and fruit. Coffee was decent. Nice perk if you're staying there.

Text: Pleasantly surprised at at this DoubleTree.

Room was a very good size and comfortable. Loved having a balcony and robes in the room. Room service was reasonably priced and delicious.  Wished there was bath tub but the shower was huge.  

Will definitely stay here again!

Text: Great staff; very friendly & helpful. This is definitely a lively hotel. Guests like to congregate in the lobby, bar & restaurant area & mingle. I had a suite. Very nice. Had a sitting room with desk area and a separate bedroom. Comforts of home. I'll be back.
