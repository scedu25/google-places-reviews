Motel 6 Davenport Ia
Rating: 4
Text: We were late in leaving the convention, and not finding anything along our route, extended our drive to reach Davenport. I reserved a room online.  When we arrived at the hotel, there was a note to dial 0 to reach the clerk. Surprisingly, the phone rang around the corner of the hall and just out of sight and after a few minutes the clerk came to the desk and a young gentleman that was with her exited the building. She was friendly and efficient and we were soon on our way to our room.  The room was very clean, and we both had a very good nights sleep. My wife commented that although we'd been in a many starred hotel for the past week, she had the best sleep and rest of the whole week at that Motel 6!.  The outside grounds and parking lot were well lit, and the grounds were clean and neat.  The only drawbacks were a small child my wife discovered walking around the halls alone; and individuals sitting in the hallway.

Text: My vehicle broke down and I was grateful for this Motel 6 while stranded awaiting repair. Without any restaurants within walking distance (and highways), I was glad to have a refrigerator/microwave option. Could order out delivery food and store/reheat items. The staff were very friendly and helpful and responsive to your needs. Our room was clean, bed very comfortable, good extended selection of tv channels, and there is a laundry (which I needed after traveling) and an indoor pool. Also, I noted it is wonderful that the pool has a lift for disabled guests. I would stay here again over somewhere else. I could have paid more elsewhere and had less service and less friendly personnel. Linn/Lynn the evening clerk was very helpful, especially during a stressful time of car break down.

Text: Location is just off of the interstate.  The hotel and room were clean and was very quiet.  The only thing that would have made it a 10 was a small refrigerator

Text: I had a good overnight stay. The desk clerk was very nice. The room was clean and everything worked (lights/outlets/etc). The desk clerk even came down to my room and got Closed Captions on the TV for me.

Text: Stayed at two Motel6's on my fast trip home after a 14,755 mile Alaska trip. During that trip stayed at higher priced motels that included breakfast. Breakfast included means price is going to be more. Personally I don't need to waste the time eating a tasteless waffle and cornflakes. At the two Motel6's I stayed at, the coffee was hot and great tasting. The big plus was I spent for two nights, what the Choice places would charge for one nights stay. AND THE ROOMS WERE JUST AS CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE.
