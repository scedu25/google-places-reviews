Motel 6 Benton Harbor

Text: Low prices with nice employees. Rooms are normally very well kept. If you do have an issue they are open to fix it; except if it is not fixable at that moment. But they are willing to move you to another room if that option is available.

Text: It was horrible, I checked in at 10pm they gave me room 134. The hot water lever was broken off. They switched me to a double bed and it was full of cockroaches, I also took pictures of the roaches. I go back to the front desk and was stuck in the lobby for a hr while they give me another room. Just to get 134 again. I had to stay because I didn’t have any more nunnery to go any where else and I had to go out of town Sunday. The manager wasn’t there so I was told to call Monday morning to speak to him. When I called this morning, the manager told me that I broke the lever hung up in my face. I did not appreciate that at all. The experience was a total disaster. I will like a refund.

Text: Do not book here. The pictures on the website is not how the room looks. The walls looked like there's been people pissing on it. The floor was dirty. The sink' s drain was broken so it would fill up and we had to wait til it drained on its own. The bathroom was horrible. I didn't want to use the toilet and the shower was also broken. Just overall a disgusting hotel. We had our little kids with us and I didn't feel safe having them stay there it was so filthy.

Text: Front desk clerk was friendly, room was clean, but as I was standing at the sink, I saw something out of the corner of my eye run across the floor.  I looked and it was a mouse.  It ran in the bathroom and I never saw it again (there was a gap under the bathtub). Rm 136. Called front desk clerk and she did offer to move me to another room but I declined.  I've stayed at many Motel 6's, but this was the first time I've ever encountered a mouse in a room.

Text: Person at the front desk was pleasant and the t.v. worked, but other than that nothing good to say. Stains on the walls, bugs crawling around on the floor, bathroom floor tiles loose, shower barely working, bedspreads looked dirty. Someone came in and turned the air off while we were gone. Young children running around in the parking lot at all hours. Will never stay here again.
