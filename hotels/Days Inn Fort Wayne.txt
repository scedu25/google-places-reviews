Text: Not very clean, in fact after walking on the  carpet, I discovered my feet were black. That probably explains the smell too. Only good things were, the bed was comfortable and the staff were nice.

Text: Horrible. Super dirty. Bad breakfast, should I say bearly any breakfast. Over charged. When I walked in the room the rug make your feet dirty and smells musty. But the staff is nice I guess.

Text: Customer service was nice. Our first (non-smoking) room smelled like cigarette smoke. Luckily Days Inn had a second room available for us, which still had a weird funky smell. Its LOUD here because of the freeway and some the noisy guest. I did not feel safe here. I placed a chair in front of the door. The bed is comfy, but the bed dressings are cheap and not warm. The heater in the room is nice, but I could not read the scratched off labels. All in all, Days Inn Fort Wayne was not a good place to stay. Don't do it!
