Text: For the price, your room size is tiny. Big enough for the bed and that's about it. They have detached bathrooms and kind of smell. The breakfast in the morning is just doughnuts muffins and coffee, nothing special. They do have a very friendly and sweet dog Lilly. If you want a cheap place during the week, this is your place. Otherwise look elsewhere.

Text: It is a quaint place to stay in the midst of everything. Definitely needs a little attention to rooms. The only thing I didn't care for was that and no bathrooms in the rooms. Not good if you take water pills. Otherwise, nice staff and good price!!

Text: Had a great time and enjoyed some fantastic cocktails at the Red Moon speakeasy. The bartender was a great personality. Will definitely come back. Also, you must ask to try the Harvest Moon cocktail!

Text: The hotel was perfect for what we needed. We were looking for somewhere cheap and they were it. The staff was very friendly and upfront abouy everything. The hotel is located downtown just a few minutes walk from to the shore. The only downside is there are community bathrooms on each floor, no wifi or TVs in the room which the staff told us upfront before booking. The rooms are a little small so it may be hard with children. It is perfect for a quick place to stay.
