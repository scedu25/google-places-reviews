Text: This place is great! Some friends and I stayed here a few weeks back, and I highly recommend this cabin to everyone. We brought our four wheelers and there are tons of trails and old logging roads to ride, and plenty of sights to see. The jacks fork river is just a short ride away and is beautiful. We can't wait to come back and spend another weekend.

Text: A perfect place to be. The cabin was homey, comfortable, and clean.
We had a great time. 
Target practice, hiking, hunting Morel (?) Mushrooms, and so much more.
If only we had more time to stay. Thank you!

Text: This is a beautiful, serene piece of paradise. I live in Nashville and visit at least 3 or 4 times a year. It's nice to get away from the fast paced enviro and relax with a coffee, good book, and great view. Anicia and Drew (proprietors) are friendly and helpful. I've never experienced an issue while staying here. Great people and a great place to relax. The area also has great hiking and several rivers to float or canoe.
