Crow Valley Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This place is outstanding in all areas. Who needs to pull the trailer far when you can enjoy nature walks, fishing, meditation and more so close to home. Rindy and Scott are amazing owners. They have spent many hours and money on building up a place needing it. Their workers or even those who just help out from the kindness of their hearts make things possible as well. You can see their passion for not only there business but those who come to enjoy all the hidden gems.

Text: We stayed here for 3 days to be close to family while visiting.  

-The overall vibe was not very welcoming, the office was often closed 
which made it difficult to do business, obtain guest passes etc.. Felt like it was an inconvenience when I did find the office open. 
-No laundry facilities on site. 
-No full service sites. (Power and water only)
-The sites are cramped and dirty, no cement slab or gravel, just dirt. (MUD!!)
-The roads are full of pot holes
-The pool closes at 8pm (It's summer! The sun is still out and the kids still want to play!)  At 8:15 the hall monitors on golf carts were yelling at the kids to get out. 
-The site I was renting had 6 identical open sites next to me, but rather than leave me where I was set up, they called and told me if I intended to stay another day I was going to have to move because my specific site had been reserved.  It's a Wednesday... not a weekend, not a holiday, not even a "nice day" It was pouring rain and had more rain in the forecast for the next few days...  I find it hard to believe that my specific site was required for their incoming guest. I figured they just didn't want my business and I chose to find another campground.
