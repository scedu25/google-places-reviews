Text: The room was very nice, but the bed was pretty hard - too hard for my personal taste. We had a nice shower, in-room coffee, and a refrigerator that was actually set at the correct temperature so things were cold without freezing them - quite unusual in my experience. It had a microwave, desk and chair, and a nice upholsterd chair. Internet service was very good as was the free breakfast that I ate. The swimming pool area was fantastic and the kids absolutely had a blast! Service was prompt and polite. Located on the east side of town, it was not the most convenient location for our purposes, but I think it was worth the extra drive for the amenities. It is close to shopping and some restaurants that we visited. If the bed had been just a bit softer, I would give them 5 stars instead of four. It was all in all a fantastic place for our family reunion.

Text: The people at the front desk were quite rude upon arrival but shortly after they seemed alright.  The pool is nice and so is the location. The rooms are nice and spacious. The one downfall, there are NO elevators.  It's only 2 floors but it made it difficult with kids trying to carry everything up to the second floor.
