Text: My wife and I had our wedding and reception at this beautiful historic mansion. The owner has done an amazing job restoring this building to its proper beauty. After a wonderful evening, we woke to a delicious breakfast, would recommend staying here if traveling, or just need a night away.

Text: Stayed two nights in this beautiful old Mansion and loved it. My husband and I had never stayed in a bed and breakfast and needed to be in the St Joe area for a couple of nights and found this one while looking for a motel and we decided to give it a try. So glad we did. The room and furnishings were so beautiful. Everything was very clean and neat. The owner showed us around and made us feel so comfortable. The breakfast both mornings was very good and the young Lady that prepared and served it to us was great. Would stay again in a heartbeat.

Text: Accidentally booked the wrong day. Didn't get a phone call or anything on the night that I was a "no show" and they wouldn't give even a partial refund. They were plenty happy to just take the money and run.
