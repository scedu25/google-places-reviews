Text: I love this place and would definitely stay here again. There is so much attention to detail like the nice hand soap in the bathroom, extra pillows, perfectly placed decor, and the complementary teas put out for us.The price is great for a B&b. The breakfast was delicious. The house was beautiful and clean. The neighborhood felt safe. The innskeeper was very friendly and genuine. She made us feel like we were staying with family.
