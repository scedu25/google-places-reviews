Text: The room was great! Everything was clean and tidy when I arrived. The clerk at the front desk was also very nice and helpful. The breakfast in the morning was also pretty decent in size and variety of hot food. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quality hotel for either a short or extended stay!
