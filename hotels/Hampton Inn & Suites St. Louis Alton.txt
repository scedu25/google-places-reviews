Hampton Inn & Suites St. Louis/Alton
Rating: 5
Text: When I travel, I always look for a Hampton first. This one is just over a year old. It is in a great Central location in Alton. Very nice common area. The rooms are very nice. This trip, it's my wife and I. King bed, refrigerator, and microwave in room. I'm impressed and it is keeping with Hampton quality. The hosts at the check in are very friendly and cordial.

I will NEVER use the Hampton again. I sent all of my bridal party and guests to the hotel trusting them to have basic customer service! 

Instead of telling my guests to go to the lobby because they made too much noise, they CALLED THE POLICE!!! All they had to say was go to the lobby!!! But no! Our BEST MAN had to sleep in his car! 

Not only that they over charged my guest from the agreed upon price!

I am mortified for inconveniencing my guests

Text: I laughed out loud at the Angry Bride's review and am glad the hotel staff called the police because her "wedding party" was too loud. Classic. ... This hotel is perfect if you're looking for a quiet, clean, convenient place to stay while on a business trip or road trip. No complaints.
