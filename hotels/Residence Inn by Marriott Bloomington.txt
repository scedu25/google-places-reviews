Text: For a 3-star hotel, we certainly had a 5-star experience. From the woman working the desk at check-in who gave us some gift certificates to a local pizza place to the EXCELLENT breakfast (they had a vegetarian scramble that was amazing - in Bloomington, of all places!) to the woman working at breakfast who gave my kids coloring books, I simply couldn't have been more impressed. The manager was conducting a staff meeting as we were leaving - and everyone was smiling. A hallmark of well-run employer, in my opinion!

Text: The rooms were clean but the beds were terrible. The lobby was very nice with a fire pit outside as well as an indoor pool. The service was friendly and check in and check out went smoothly.

Text: Nice hotel and staff. Breakfast is just ok, but there are always healthy options, which is nice. The rooms are nice. I would give 5 stars but I always ask for my room to be defeathered and instead, I get two extra foam pillows but the feathered pillows are still there. I've had more allergy issues at this hotel because of that, even when I remove the feather pillows from the room. Kathy, who makes the food for the evening mixes, is really sweet and makes the place feel a bit more like home!
