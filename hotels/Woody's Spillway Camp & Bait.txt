Text: Great location, good people, excellent selection and value! If you need anything to land your next catch this is the place. If you don't see what you are looking for in the store just ask!  Excellent family (and pet)friendly campground near Mississinewa Reservoir with all the amenities anyone could ask for. Just remember if you "aren't having fun it's your own dam fault"
