Text: We stayed in the large cabin and also rented several of the small ones for my sons wedding. It was MAGICAL!! The best experience our family has ever had.  The cabin was decorated for Christmas. It was spacious, and handled our 15 people comfortably in the large cabin and another 15 in the other smaller cabins. The jacuzzi tub, large open kitchen, Christmas lights, windows... everything made it perfect. The staff was superb!

Text: We'd heard this was the best place to stay in Nauvoo, and we weren't disappointed. We were in the Nixon cabin and it was splendid. Spacious and roomy it easily slept our 6 kids upstairs and Mom and Dad in the private bedroom downstairs. The kitchen allowed us to eat in, a serious savings for a large group. Absolutely perfect place to stay!

Text: Loved our stay at the Nauvoo Log Cabins. It was like journeying to the past with modern conveniences. We stayed in the Jameson cabin and the family all enjoyed it. From the bunk bed to the little kitchen it was very fun. We knew there was a kitchen to cook so we stopped in Carthage on the way to Nauvoo and bought a little bit of groceries to make dinner and breakfast. The cabin had all the cooking utensils. There were pans, plates, bowls, silverware and cups. There is a laundromat on site if needed and the bathroom was fully stocked with towels and toiletries. They do provide a Wi-Fi password but the reception in Nauvoo is very poor for Internet, so expect to get a real dose of living in the past and putting down the electronics and spending some real quality time with your family.
