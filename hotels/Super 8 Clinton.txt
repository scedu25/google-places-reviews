Text: Been traveling across the country for 3+weeks and used a lot of super eight hotels in many states. This is the worst of the worst. There is no refrigerator or microwave in room. Floors creak and groan terribly. Lots of noise here. Overpriced for the condition of rooms. Toilet leaked huge pools of water when flushed. Room stunk terribly. Waffle iron and microwave broken in breakfast room. Out of most breakfast items and wouldn't get any more out.  Very unprofessional staff. Do not use this in super 8.

Text: Very very basic, terrible bed pillows are a joke 1 hard chair for the desk. Furniture is way out of date definitely no money spent on up keep here. 
Hotel is clean the woman at desk is wonderful.would be ok for a quick night sleep if no where else is available but absolutely not comfortable enough for an extended period of time. 
I work on the road and basically I can't really come in and relax to a hard bed and crappy chair.
