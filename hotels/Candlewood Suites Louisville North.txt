Candlewood Suites Louisville North

Text: Had my son's birthday party in the room and poolside. Staff was very accommodating, even allowing us to get an early check-in. And the party was a huge hit! Accommodations were great, and as shown on the page.

Text: Great hotel! The amenities are great including free laundry, pool, gym, and grill. Great clean rooms. But it is an extended stay so they only do housekeeping once a week. Other than that they are great.

Text: My house flooded and I'll be staying here for probably a couple of weeks. I've been here 5 days now and it has been great. The staff is great. They are doing everything they can to make it feel like home. I even have my two dogs with me. The beds and pillows are very comfortable.  You would think allowing pets it would be messy. Not here. You'd never know a pet was ever here unless you see it or hear it. Close to everything. Outback steakhouse next door, and all major stores are within 1-2 miles. They even offer free dinner on Wednesday night. Last night was pizza. I could live here has all I need, except oven. They do have everything else to cook on. Even have gas grills outside in a nice covered area. From now on when I travel, I'm going to try to find a Candlewood suites.

Text: Front desk was warm and friendly. Room was very very clean. Either the hotel is brand new or very recently updated. Air Conditioning was super effective in our room. Pool was available.
