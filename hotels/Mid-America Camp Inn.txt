Mid-America Camp Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Spent the night in the truck stop in front of Mid-America Camp Inn. Looked around at it and it's very clean, safe and well maintained. Says on it's website it welcomes big rigs. Has a lot of amenities. When we go through we plan on staying here. Secure and safe, very quiet. Nice people!

Text: Ok for over night.  Needs lots of work. Owner was very pleasant.  Lots of stickers in the grass.  Stuck to shoes and dog!

Text: It's only getting 2 stars because it had cable and good wifi. We pulled in here during a snow storm and waited it out. They only take cash so we had to walk across to the gas station in the blizzard twice to get cash out. Went in to pay 2 different times and no one is downstairs. The place is absolutely disgusting and they're clearly hoarders, it's actually sad.

Text: Great wifi.
Pool is closed. Playground is vintage (I took pictures because I had not seen a slide like this one since first grade)
The office Decor is quaint.

Treat yourself to this park. But don't take the children or pets.

Text: Work across the way seems like busy place, must be reasonable and nice.
