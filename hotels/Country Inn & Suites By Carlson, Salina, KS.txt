Text: It was such a cute little hotel witht he fireplace and cookies right when you walk in. Love that the room has a door separating the bedroom and living room great for staying with the baby. And the crib fit through the door so we could put her to sleep and roll her in to the living room when it was time for us to go to sleep. The breakfast was also very nice, lots of options. Wonderful experience

Text: Really enjoyed this hotel. They had everything I needed right in the room. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mouthwash, and even a cloth makeup remover! I was very impressed. Usually cheaper proceed hotels like this only have shampoo and soap.

The bed was also very comfy, room temp controls were easy to understand, and check in was a breeze. They made my stay as easy and effortless as possible. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: Our room was great, staff was super helpful, price was great as well. The breakfast wasn't bad either. The best part of the breakfast was the amount of choices. Location was a ways from the freeway, but still not bad. All in all, great for the price.

Text: It was clean, cozy,  & reasonably priced, considering the expense of Hotels these days! 

The staff were friendly & helpful.  
Two employees came at 11pm to correct television settings so we could view the weather. They were professional,  yet funny & vet happy to help. 

I would stay here again!
