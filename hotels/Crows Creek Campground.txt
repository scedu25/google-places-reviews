Crows Creek Campground
Rating: 5
Text: This is a beautiful campground. The slips are nice and easy to access. The grounds are amazing. The bathrooms are good enough. I didn’t need them that why the high rating. The paved walking trail is in great shape. Wish I had booked more than a one night stop over. This would be a place I’d get comfortable and stay awhile!

Text: Crows creek is a nice campground.  The setting is beautiful, and the campsites are fairly level, and spacious.  The showers are clean if simple, and there are enough of them.  Be cautious when reserving your site.  Some are double sites, and this puts you pretty close to your neighbor.  We got lucky that our neighbors were nice, but we hadn't planned to be so close to anyone.

Text: We had a good time camping and watching the eclipse here. The management could have planned better for the crowd and had more dumpsters, or an extra emptying. They were all overflowing. Most of the restrooms were nice, but there are some older ones in need of upgrading. The grassy area were well kept. A very relaxing experience.

Text: Great place, the maintenance and support staff are great. The fishing and boating is as good if not better than anywhere in the state. Camp grounds and bath houses are better than most National Parks.  But, the Rangers are a bunch of bullies. And all the support staff would agree, just ask them.

Text: We had  misfortune of obnoxious neighbors on the tent campsite. They brought in two 6' tall speakers and played club music from 3pm - 11pm. All we could hear was relentless boom-boom-boom. Rangers said they had no authority to stop them. Shame, it's a beautiful location, but won't be returning to this campsite.
