Holiday Inn Executive Center-Columbia Mall

Text: Wonderful place to stay! Accommodations are beyond expectations! It can accommodate most any need you have. The extras: 2 restaurants (sports and a 4 star), a hair salon, coffee bar, lounge with music and bar, gift shop, room service... So many great extras plus they give you vouchers for freebies and/or discounts.
The rooms are big, comfy and very nice. The supplies are beyond your soap and shampoo/conditioner...
Honestly, too many extras to even list. You can even swap your pillows if they're not hard or soft enough!
They aim to please and it is appreciated... 
Packed house while we are here but the staff and their service doesn't show signs of stress or business.  Works like a well oiled machine!

Text: Place was nice. A little outdated. Handicapped room was down a floor and almost at the end of the hall.

Text: Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The room was clean. My only complaint would be that the shower wouldn't get very warm and the shower head on our room was very low (I'm 5'4" and barely fit under it)!

Text: Good hotel...my room had desk right next to a/c unit which had cold air blowing on me while trying to work.
