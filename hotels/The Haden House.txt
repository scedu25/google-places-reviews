Text: This is the place to stay in Eldora! The family that runs this B&B were kind, generous, and extremely welcoming. The food selection was amazing and the space was a very generous size with a private entrance, private sitting area, separate sleeping area, and private bath. The rate was reasonable and the accommodations were top notch!
