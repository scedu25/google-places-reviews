Candlewood Suites Terre Haute
Rating: 5
Text: This was an amazing experience! We had to stay for a week because of a house fire. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful. The hotel was extremely clean and laundry is free. The location is kid friendly ( next to the Children’s Museum) and everything downtown is within walking distance. Definitely recommend!!!

Text: Very nice location with a beautiful room. The beds were very comfortable and the service was better than I anticipated. I would definitely stay here again and I would also recommend this location to visitors staying in Terre Haute.

Text: Very clean and nice. The staff is friendly. The parking is ok, we managed to find street parking for free with a uhaul trailer right outside if the hotel. Our car is fine this morning. The room was only $110, and it's gigantic. It's basically a small apartment with a kitchen. We were not expecting that for such a low price! It was a nice surprise! They do allow pets with a fee, but that was just fine!

Text: Touring comedian Jonnie Wethington recently stayed here while performing nearby and had a great stay! The room was perfect, clean, and very quiet. The staff was awesome and very friendly considering the really late check-in (the convenience store was great to have after the gig), and even provided a late check-out so our client could take full advantage of the laundry room, and fitness center in the morning before hitting the road!

Text: Amazing place to stay, the rooms are clean and spacious, up to date, and the staff is very accommodating. Compared to other hotels in the area this is very good for its price. The only thing that could be better is if it had a free breakfast in the mornings.
