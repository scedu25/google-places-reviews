Holiday Inn Express & Suites Cincinnati SE Newport
Rating: 4
Text: Stayed in a King Bed Suite. The rooms have been recently remodeled. The room was nice, plenty of lighting and electric outlets. Complementary breakfast was fair. Front desk staff seemed nice. Only complaint was noise from room next door. Read other reviews about thin walls, so this may be a factor, especially when I could hear the couple next door engaging in an extracurricular activity. The location was convenient.

Text: Nice to stay here, comfortable beds, great shower! Pool too cool. Attention needed on our two windows, curtains with missing hooks.
Great location.

Text: This was my second stay at this hotel and it was just like any other Holiday Inn Express. The floor I was on was under renovations, but I was given a newly renovated room. Big changes to the typical hotel room layout. They have removed a lot of the old furnishings that took up much of the floor space with newer less restricting furnishings. I like the new look. Breakfast was good as usual. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to those visiting the area.

Text: The amenities were great, and the breakfast wasn't bad either. The room itself was in good shape. I'd highly recommend the hotel if in the area.
