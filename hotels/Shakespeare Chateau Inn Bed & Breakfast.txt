Shakespeare Chateau Inn Bed & Breakfast

Text: Creepy but beautiful. I photographed a wedding party getting ready here. Spacious, a lot larger than you would even imagine looking at the outside I felt like. They are serious about parking because they have tenants who also need to park/get their cars out so make sure you know how many cars can be parked and where.

Text: What a wonderful B&B!  The owner has done a magnificent job returning this late 1800's mansion into it's original condition. She has done her homework and shared all of her knowledge on everything about the place, from the different kinds of wood in every room to the exquisite wall paper in the dining room which is from the same manufacturer that Jackie Kennedy chose a pattern for the White House. It was my daughters first experience with a B&B. She's hooked ;) Definitely look forward to staying there again!

Text: We were completely enthralled by everything about this glorious hideaway!  Loved the care that was taken by the proprietor, the breakfast was beyond superb and the atmosphere was absolutely unmatched by any other place we have ever stayed during our travels!  Wish we could have stayed for longer than one night and will be booking here again in the future!  Thank you for taking such wonderful care of us!

Text: Fantastic house with more original stain glass windows than any other house in North America.  Lovingly restored mansion with an excellent host. Spacious comfortable rooms and bedding.  Breakfast was wonderful.  Hope we are able to visit again.
