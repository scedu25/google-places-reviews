Hilton Garden Inn Omaha Downtown/Old Market Area

Text: Beautiful room. Clean and comfortable. Very welcoming staff. The desk clerk recommended a great bar where we could eat and have a drink before the Neil Diamond concert. I only have 2 complaints. The first is that the restaurant inside the hotel closed at around midnight. We didn't want to eat but it would have been nice to have a night cap. Secondly, our room was facing a busy street so it was noisy. Otherwise, it's a great place to stay. Convenient to the highway and lots of bars and restaurants.

Text: We we're in town for a concert at the Cenury Link Center which was short two block walk from the hotel. The room was clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. The complimentry cookies and coffee we're awesome! It is also located close to some of the best places to eat in the downtown market area. It is the best place to stay hands down.

Text: Excellent staff! Rooms are nice, but housekeeping could use a kick in the pants! The filters in our AC unit hadn't been cleared in a bit and microwave was nasty (& behind it was KY - eww!). Also the outlet on the unit with fridge isn't connected (that's how we found what was behind the microwave)! Would still return just because the staff was so great!

Text: Stayed here a couple of times on business and was extremely satisfied both times. Staff was always available and very friendly. No complaints as to the cleanliness of my room. The breakfast buffet in the morning is high quality with an array of meat, eggs, potatoes, fruits and other breakfast staples to choose from. The attached restaurant, Spencer's, is one of the better steak spots I've been to in Omaha and you can access it through the lobby.

Text: Staff was friendly and very helpful. Gave excellent recommendations for food and things to do with great directions on how to get there. Rooms were good size. A little noise with it being college football opening weekend.
