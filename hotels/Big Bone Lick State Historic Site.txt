Text: We heard of this park while driving to The Ark Encounter and wanted to do something on a day we weren’t doing anything. The gift shop was pretty cool with a mini museum inside and the lady inside was cool and entertaining. If you plan on going on the trails I recommend you where shoes (I know that’s a given) but I wore flip flops which I did fine. The trails were COOL leading you through the woods to different parts in the park. The Salt Springs definitely has an aroma of sulfur. We had to walk quite a bit to see the Bison probably because at the time of day we went they decided to be chillin far from onlookers. We brought a binoculars to see them from afar off. They were pretty cool since they were linked to the ice age. We took our lunch and ate at the lake which was very quite, calming and relaxing after walking the trails. Nice little place if you like the outdoors and hiking a little.

Text: We stayed at the Campground inside the park this August. The staff was friendly, and the campsites were a good size. The grounds were well maintained and the Camp Hosts were very informative. There are trails that lead down to the lake, to the Bison, and the Museum from the campground. While we were viewing the Bison we were greeted by their caretaker and he was very friendly and informative. The Museum staff was fun and they offered an entire days worth of family activities. The parks signage about the displays is in desperate need of being replaced. I could not make out what was written on the signage at all. Overall we enjoyed Big Bone Lick and would return in the future.

Text: Wonderful state park. The Salt Spring trail is an easy trek and there is a nice view of Big Bone Creek and the salt lick. The salt lick gives off a sulpuric stink. The bison are not far from the museum/gift shop. The museum is small but has plenty of information about Big Bone Lick and if you enjoy rock collecting the gift shop has a nice, inexpensive selection.

Text: This is a place for all ages.  Nice parks for the kids to play.  Nice little museum about the parks history.  Then add in a heard of bison that are basically as right in front of you.  To it off one just had a baby a few weeks before or visit.  Love the place and normally head there a few times a year.
