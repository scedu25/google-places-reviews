Holiday Inn Express & Suites Dayton West - Brookville
Rating: 4
Text: No hot tub.  Drove 9 hours and no hot tub.  I was told they used to have one, bit it was taken out at the remodel.  That sucks, but seems like most hotels are doing away with them.

The place was blissfully quiet after our long drive. The room was spacious and the bed is awesome.  I asked for 6 pillows when I made my online reservation, and there were 6 pillows on the bed when we got there.

It's pricey for a one-night stay, but I got the rest I needed.  The breakfast buffet is decent.  I was surprised to see sausage gravy.  Sadly no biscuits so I topped my eggs.

Text: Checked me in early. Always greet you when you walk in and out even if they are doing something. Clean and updated rooms. Pool was chilly and stained but obviously clean. Chilly is probably nice in the summer. Continental breakfast has more variety than expected.

Text: This franchise seems to barely make the bar for the chain. Very warm humid common area. The employees say the owners keep it that way. Maybe to save power? Swimming pool was dingy. Looks like the filter is not running as often as it should. We were given keys to a pre-occupied room. Accidental but still embarrassing. Not a dump but a solid "C" rating for me.
By the way: Holiday Inn invited me to post feedback on their site but was rejected because of this exact content.

Text: Room was clean and nice, a little small. I've had better breakfasts at other Holiday inn Expresses, but it wasn't too bad.

Text: Not all Holiday Inns are equal. Was somewhat disappointed with my stay, the hotel hallways and rooms had a strange smell, the bathroom didn't seem to be well maintained, and the breakfast room was small and cramped. Although the staff was friendly, I have stayed at other Holiday Inns that seem to be maintained much better.
