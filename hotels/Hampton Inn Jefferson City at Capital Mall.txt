Hampton Inn Jefferson City at Capital Mall
Rating: 2
Text: Friendly staff. As we were getting ready for bed I found a bug crawly in the bathroom. I made sure to check the beds before we laid down.  The decor was dated.  The room was overpriced with a parking lot not even half full after 8 pm at night. Breakfast was good. I told the clerk about the bug in the morning. She seemed concerned. I had killed the bug with a Kleenex in case they would need to see it. She asked me to bring it down, so I did. The clerk response was: "Do I need to do something?" I asked what she meant and she followed up my question with a question of: "did you enjoy the rest of your stay?' to which I answered yes. So, I give this stay 2 stars for finding a bug, a horrible bed, and old looking decor for the price.

Text: Extremely professional staff.  10pm quiet time is great for business travel.  One of the nicest Hampton Inns I've been in.

Text: Original decor and style of a Hampton Inn in the 90s or early 2000. This hotel has not been upgraded to a great extent, but has a fairly low rack rate.

Text: It was a wonderful experience. We checked in very late because we spent the day with our in laws happily  helping our son and daughter in law move into their first home.  The hotel was super clean and convenient.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and comfortable.  It is a lovely place to relax. We want to stay here again! Thank you.

Text: Nice public areas. Rooms are a little dark and dated. Fine place to stay, though.
