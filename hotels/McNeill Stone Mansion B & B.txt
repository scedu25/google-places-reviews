Text: Wonderful hospitality in a beautifully decorated bed and breakfast. Our room was quite large with a nice bath, queen size bed all decorated in red a cents. Food was delicious too plus snacks and drinks available 24/7. Our second trip there, and it was still a wonderful experience!

Text: This is a gem in the heart of Iowa. Beautiful restored home, hosts are wonderful, with excellent hospitality and fun historic information about the mansion. We stayed in the penthouse suit and were impressed with size and elegance. Breakfast was delicious and well balanced with fruit, veggie egg dish, ham and pastry. Wide selection of tea. I'd highly recommend this bed and breakfast!

Text: Warm and friendly hosts, spacious, clean,and luxurious rooms. The bed and breakfast is a beautiful restoration of an early 1900s mansion. Breakfast is generous and delicious. Appears to be the best place to stay in Oskaloosa.

Text: Our stay was very brief, but wonderful.  Absolutely no complaints.  Our suite was very clean and comfortable. Very comfortable bed.  The mansion is beautiful and the owners are great people.  Breakfast was quite delicious and elegant.  I wish we could have stayed longer.  If we are back in the area we would certainly return and I highly recommend this B&B to those that could and would appreciate the hosts, the property, history and elegance of this mansion.
