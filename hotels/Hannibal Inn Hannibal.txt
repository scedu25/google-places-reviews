Text: If your looking for a no frills, inexpensive place to stay, this would be it.  This looks like it used to be a Holiday Inn in its Glory days.  

The rooms are decent & clean.  There was a tube tv, small fridge, microwave, & coffee pot in our room.  The linens were clean and no signs of any bugs.  

The pool had little bunches of bubbles on the surface which I assume is due to lack of proper filtration to remove soap residue left in swim suits but the hot tub was clear.  The hot tub was relaxing even though it didn't bubble as much as it should have. 

The breakfast was somewhat worse than normal hotel breakfast.

If your looking for an ok (not great, not horrible) place to stay on a low budget, this would be an option.

Text: Needs updated. Lots of rooms open but gave me one that didn't have a number and key cards didn't work for it. They then put me in another room. But definitely needs an update on everything.
