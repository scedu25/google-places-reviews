Text: Everything went great during my stay here. They accommodated our late arrival with no questions asked, and we got into our rooms in a timely manner. The breakfast buffet was also really good. My only complaint was the water pressure was very very low and to give something 5 stars everything has to be perfect, but this was a near-perfect experience.
