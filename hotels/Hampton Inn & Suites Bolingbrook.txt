Hampton Inn & Suites Bolingbrook
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here as part of our wedding block we had booked. Everyone at the hotel was very helpful with getting everything set up for us including multiple shuttle trips in each direction. Room itself was very nice and had plenty of room for me and the groomsmen to get ready on the day of. Location was rather convenient and only about 15 minutes from our wedding venue. Overall very satisfied with our experience.

Text: Really nice hotel.  Very clean.  Breakfast had great fresh fruit and nice seating area. But sausage both days we were there; I prefer when they alternate sausage and bacon.  Pool was nice, but no hot tub.

Text: Good location. Room could have been a little cleaner. Overall an ok stay but would likely seek a better place in the area next time.

Text: Do not stay here! Or if you do make sure to check for bugs!. The general manager I promise will not get back to you if a problem arises. Or will the Hampton. 
Had A bed bug, and spiders!
