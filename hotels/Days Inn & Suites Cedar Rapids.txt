Text: Nice place and good location with a Mexican restaurant next door that is very good. The only problem with this place is they use those very thick bulbous type pillows. They are at least 6 inches thick. When you sleep on them your neck is wrenched up whether you're laying on your back or on your side. Poor planning in terms of ergonomics and getting good sleep. Other than that a nice place

Text: I'm fairly sure not all the rooms are this way but we had a room with two beds and the beds were so small that we had to sleep one per bed we're still married we usually sleep together so that was kind of different. The lady at the front desk was exceptional she answered all of our questions had recommendations for food was very knowledgeable of the area and had a fantastic attitude. The lady that checked us out this morning was also had a fantastic attitude and was very helpful the staff was great.

Text: Clean, nice, and reasonably priced. The only issue I had was the pool not opening until 10 a.m.! I like to take a nice swim in the morning and by 10 we are on the road. So I wasn't able to use the pool like I had originally planned.

Text: Wow, we got an unbelievably great deal through expedia combining flight & room with this hotel. Yet it did not lack service, cleanliness & politeness. It was very good. The lobby always had iced lemon water. The continental breakfast had biscuits & gravy, make your own waffles, bananas, apples, yougurt, & toast mini muffins ect. It stayed open until 10:00am. The checkout was noon!! Perfect for late risers!

Text: Rooms clean. Air works. Beds are comfy for a hotel. Breakfast was good. Stayed twice at this location. (1) night and a 4 night stay. No complaints either time
