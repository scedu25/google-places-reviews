Text: Great camping experience,  we had a primitive site by the Wabash River,  quiet, peaceful, senic. The staff was very helpful and pleasant.  It looks like they have a theme 1 night of the weekend,  we had a chili dinner night the food was really good and it was all you could eat.  My family is going to plan at least 2 camping trips every year at this place yearly.  The other campers we're courteous to surrounding campers and offered any help if needed.  They offer showers, laundry and firewood at a very reasonable price they even deliver the wood.  Fantastic place for the kids and family.

Text: We loved this campground!  Everyone was super friendly!  And the hosts were so welcoming!  We had coffee with them and Milo the dog our first morning there!  Would most definitely return if we are ever in the area again!

Text: Very friendly staff, roomy sites. Not totally level sites, but not bad either. I've seen much worse.  All in all, I liked it and I'd come back.  Very pleased.

Text: I have been reading the reviews, and I had to speak up. My husband and I stayed here with our children and had a very great experience! We would have brought our dog but he passed away shortly before coming. The management was extremely nice and informative about fun things to do in the area, and the fun things planned there throughout the year. This is a campground with so many things to do! We weren't able to go riverside due to flooding but that was because of safety not anything in the owner's control. We absolutely loved the scenery here, we camped in a primitive site in a tent and were treated with respect, and are really hoping to go back in a couple weekends, watching the weather though as it may rain us out unfortunately. Thank you for everything hope to see you again soon.
