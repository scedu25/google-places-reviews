Days Inn Kingdom City
Rating: 4
Text: Firstly the rooms were clean although they do show their age. The morning continental breakfast was a little sparse, they food warmer was empty a half hour after breakfast opened and was refilled the 15 min. I was there. The staff was rather friendly and accommodating. Overall decent place for $60 a night.

Text: Here's the wishing the beds were bigger but everything is clean and comfortable. The air condition works great and they serve a decent breakfast in the morning. But remember when the bed say they sleep two adults it's far from large enough. It may sleep one adult and child comfortably depending on how big your kid is but overall the breakfast the rooms the swimming pool and the customer service is Pleasant

Text: Was on the road for 5 hours and just needed a room to sleep for a few hours and let the rain pass. It was better than I thought it was going to be and the 3rd shift staff was awesome and accommodating. The inn is older but clean and everything functioned. For what it is it's pretty good.

Text: Do NOT stay here.  I have NO idea what rooms the other reviewers stayed in but let me just say:  filthy, bugs, burns in sheets, smelled, just simply unclean and terrible.
