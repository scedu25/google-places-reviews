Loews Chicago O'Hare Hotel

Text: AWESOME!  The rooms are so wonderfully decorated, beds comfortable, the pillows and comforter over the top! I didn't want to get out of bed.  But glad I did because yet the next wonderful surprise is the punctual shuttle ride to the airport.. The restaurant in lobby had the best homemade Chicken soup.  Cant wait to come back.

Text: Great location near the airport, food and an outlet mall in walking distance and the rooms are modern and attractive. The price was great too at $109 on a Sat night. They have a shuttle. It’s a good walk at O’Hare to catch the shuttle. I recommend Uber or a taxi. It’s very close.

Text: Staff made me feel very welcome. Check in was very fast, very clean and beautiful foyer. Room was spacious, clean, and bathroom was tile floor to ceiling. Garage parking, restaurants within walking distance, large park across the street. Our room had a view of the Chicago skyline. Reasonably priced for a two bed room with safe and refrigerator.

Text: I was here for a conference and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very attentive and the facilities were very clean and well taken care of. Given this is close to O'Hare I will also add that although I could hear the air traffic, it was not nearly as loud as I would have expected and never bothered me or kept me awake. Hotel staff was even kind enough to have their shuttle take us down the street to the casino for drinks. I would recommend.

Text: Very nice hotel. Also very clean. I had a deluxe room which had a nice soaking tub. Not all rooms have bathtubs so important to ask if that's something that matters to you. Also there is a shuttle that picks people up from O'Hare between doors 1 & 2 in the shuttle area. One driver was very nice and dropped me at Rosemont station since I was going into town. Saved me a good 30-40 minutes I expect...
