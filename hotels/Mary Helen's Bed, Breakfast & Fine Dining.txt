Text: We spent last night at Mary Helen's Bed and Breakfast. It was wonderful! We were welcomed as soon as we arrived and treated like good friends. The rooms were not only spotless and beautifully furnished but were also decorated for Christmas. Everything was perfect! This morning we were served a spectacular breakfast! Cindy and Jim were outstanding hosts!  Can't wait to go back!!
