T&T Motel Apartments & Rentals
Rating: 5
Text: Such a quaint motel.  Staff is super friendly, and our stay was reminiscent of days gone by.  Felt more like visiting a much loved family member, rather than just a motel stay.  And the bathroom was super clean!  They have a fire pit where some nights the people staying start a bonfire, and everyone sits around, visiting, and becoming new friends.  Just a neat experience, these places are getting harder to find.
