ROCKHAVEN PARK EQUESTRIAN CAMPGROUND (recgovnpsdata)
Rating: 5
Text: Nice quiet campground with several good sites. Even if you don't have horses, it is a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere. The trails surrounding it are gorgeous. The restroom is not centrally located, so if you don't choose a site near it, the walk is not an especially short one. The campground closes for the season November 30.
