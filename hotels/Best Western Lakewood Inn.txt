Best Western Lakewood Inn
Rating: 4
Text: Room was clean, bathroom clean albeit small. Tv worked, air conditioner/heater worked well. Breakfast wasn't very good, but it had fresh coffee. Employees in the breakfast area continually to start conversation with my after it was fairly clear I was not interested at 7:30a, take that as you will. All in all, if you are shopping for a budget hotel that isn't disgusting I would definitely recommend it.

Text: We enjoyed our stay at this hotel so much we stopped again on our way back from vacation.   They have the best coffee!!!   The staff is friendly but professional and always asked if they could help us with anything.  The breakfast is outstanding.

Text: The service was great and the hotel seemed clean but our room smelled strongly of smoke and our  other room smelled of smoke and old urine.
