Text: Very nice hotel in a great location. The rooms are nice, the pool area is awesome for kids. The convention rooms are very nice, and the food and service during the luncheon we attended was superb. Will stay there over and over. Great place!

Text: I had a hotel block here for my wedding. Overall a very "meh" experience. Difficulties ranged from lack of communication about how many rooms were left in the block/adding rooms, to delays in allowing guests to check in to brown water dripping from vents in my family's room. In the future I'll recommend friends or family stay in the Hilton or the Iowa House Hotel
