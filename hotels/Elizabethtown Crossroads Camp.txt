Elizabethtown Crossroads Camp
Rating: 4
Text: I can't give a proper review, I just rolled through for a night tent-camping between FL and OH. From my perspective, it was perfect. Little corner of the property with a fire pit. Bathrooms are spectacular. You can hear highway, so it's not exactly a nature spot.

Text: Nice wooded campsites with a nice little lake.  Well maintained, except the playground equipment would benefit greatly from a good power-washing. Relatively well-located vs. the Bourbon Trail distilleries, which was our reason for being in Elizabethtown. Full hook-ups with both 50amp and 30amp available.

Text: Wifi never worked, cable TV spotty. Some sites were great but many are very close and cramped. The best sites are people who stay long term so if you're there for a couple of days don't expect a roomy nice site

Text: Park is located on a narrow residential street, but once you get there it's lovely.  There are several long, well trimmed pull-through sites. The one we were assigned was plenty long enough for both our 45 foot rig and 1-ton duelly. There are tons of beautiful shade trees, a catch and release pond, a play ground, a laundry room, and a small store on site. We were passing through, but would definitely return.
