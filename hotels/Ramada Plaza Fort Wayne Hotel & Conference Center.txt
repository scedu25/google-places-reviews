Text: For the conference I attended, this was an excellent venue. The facilities were neat and clean, and the audio/visual equipment all worked well. Even the lunch was good. I would gladly attend a conference here again.

Text: Very nice and clean. House keeping was very good on my stay. They were there when I needed something. I will definitely return.

Text: Easy to get to, right off I69. The rooms are very nice, with comfortable beds (although the bathrooms are a little "cozy"). We didn't get room service, but the service from our servers at the conference meals were terrific! Will definitely stay there again, if the need arises!

Text: Cool wedding venue. Didn't stay the night, but seemed like a lot going on with the pool for visitors. Hallways and a few public spaces seemed a bit dated but again, I have no experience with any of the rooms since I was there for a wedding. The wedding room itself in the domed area was nice.
