Kibu Cafe

Text: I really enjoy Kibu Cafe. It unquestionably caters to the local Asian student population. On weekends in particular, when the dorm cafeterias close, you won't hear a lot of English in the dining room... interestingly, there's a lot more Mandarin than Korean, but still.

You order at the window, and they bring the food out. Water and soup are both free and self-serve, which is a nice touch. You're encouraged to put away your own dishes.

The food quality is decent and plentiful. The staff is consistently friendly. We lean toward the spicy end of the menu. With kimchi soup, spicy squid and spicy pork, the menu gives plenty of choices. All in all, well worth a spot on the "Where would you like to eat tonight?" list, even if you're *not* an Asian Purdue student.

Text: Price is reasonable. Nice soup (free) for appetizer. Nice variety of Korean food. Taste is not exceptional but not bad as well. After you finish, you have to put your dishes away yourself.

Text: This place was alright.  I was slightly disappointed with the rice cakes in spicy sauce. My wife and i felt that the sauce was too watery. The spicy pork wad really good. We also got the spicy noodle soup with squid and mussels which was good as well. The food was spicy, but not too overwhelming.
