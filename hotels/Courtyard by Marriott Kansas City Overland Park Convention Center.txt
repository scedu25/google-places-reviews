Courtyard by Marriott Kansas City Overland Park/Convention Center
Rating: 4
Text: The room was nice, clean, modern. Nice big tv. Whole place was locked down so you felt safe. The courtyard out but was very nice, clean and lots of seating. Had a bar and diner as well.

Text: Great for a short business trip. Staff was friendly, check-in process speedy, and rooms are clean (pretty standard but clean). The bistro always comes in handy. 

There is another Courtyard Marriott just down the street, so make sure you go to the right one!
