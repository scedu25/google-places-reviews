Text: I recently had a very good experience with Margaret Roberts Travel. I drive all over the country for a living but am a real novice when it comes to recreational travel. Jodi gently lead me through the entire process of booking a cruise, booking air travel and the related hotels and shuttles. She even included a summary sheet with all the information I would need. Everything went precisely as planned. Thank you Jodi and Margaret Roberts Travel!
