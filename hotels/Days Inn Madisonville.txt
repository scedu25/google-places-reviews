Text: We had 7 rooms rented for work. 11 guys staying in them and 7 out of 11 were ate up with bed bugs. They moved rooms and still several were once again ate up. We stay in a lot of hotell for work and this is one of if not the worst we have ever came across.  Very gross and painful for my guys. 3 have had to seek medical attention for there severe bites all up and down there legs and back. Please be careful if you plan to stay here. The only side note of positivity about the place is the clerk Melissa who works there is very nice and took care of us.  The owner is the exact opposite and very ill toward guests who think bed bugs shouldn't be part of your stay.

Text: Our roomed smelled like someone had lived and smoked in it for 20 years. Roaches came out to visit. Beds had springs coming up through the covers. Bathroom was filthy and no water pressure in shower it dribbled at best. Staff at front desk rude. Waited 30 minutes to check in while front desk clerk argued with a customer on phone. Should have turned and walked away then. Only saving grace was the pool facility it was clean and well maintained. No security locks on outside doors anyone could come and go. Breakfast was unappealing and just nasty smelling. Save yourself the hassle and pay the extra $15 a night and go to nicer place.

Text: It was decent. They were the only hotel in the area that had availability at the time. The hallways seemed a little sketchy and the rooms a bit outdated but the lady in the office was really nice, the rooms were clean and there was NO bugs. I would stay again.
