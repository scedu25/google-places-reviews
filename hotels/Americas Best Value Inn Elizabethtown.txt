Americas Best Value Inn Elizabethtown
Rating: 2
Text: Located near many major roads and hiways. The sign outside of hotel says "newly renovated rooms", would hate to see what it was like before. Rooms are good-sized and plenty of parking space. Very much on the older side but has everything you need. Microwave & fridge work well, as does the ac/heater. Bed a bit lumpy, same with pillows. Biggest problem is tempermental flushing of toilet. You get what you pay for. Would think twice before staying here again.

Text: Would definitely stay again...very clean room.
Night shift desk clerk was very helpful and nice. 
Hair dryer, ironing board with iron, refrigerator, microwave, large flat screen tv in room, no coffee pot in room. Linens were clean no stains or tears. 
Room rate was great, would recommend to friends and family.

Text: Very nice inside out and they take care of there business because they want people to come stay at there place. The rooms are the best from what I've seen it off all the cheap hotels. I hope this place stays the same every year the people are nice and there is breakfast

Text: The hotel served as a fine and affordable place for my family to stay while passing through. Limited amenities, sub-par WiFi, and some infrastructure issues in the room such as non-functional power outlets. But, it was serviceable for a low expectations one-night stay, it was easy to get to from the interstate, and the staff was friendly and helpful.
