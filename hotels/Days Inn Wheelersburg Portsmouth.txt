Days Inn Wheelersburg Portsmouth
Rating: 2
Text: Stayed at this overpriced dive in a recently remodeled room that still had plastic on the light shades. It was a hot August day and we were exhausted when we checked in.. The AC made sure we stayed hot, hotter than the outside air in fact. We were just too tired to demand a new room. In the middle of the night we woke up freezing because the under powered AC was able to finally cool things off in the room exactly when we didn't need it.. Now perhaps this was a fluke, but this is isn't where it ends.. Days Inn in general deserves a lawsuit for their breakfast lie but this was even worse than most.. No fresh fruit or yogurt. Just cheap processed dime store danishes and other cheap stuff that nobody should be using to fuel their body.. For $80 a night you can do better in nearby Portsmouth or across the bridges in Kentucky..

Text: The room was very clean. In return the coffee maker in the room didn't work. Breakfast was a joke. Little Debbie Honey buns, the small white donuts from a bag and dry cereal. No coffee again. They have everything set up for waffles but the machine is broke. Lol

Text: Parking is easily accessible. The room, at the least the one I stayed in, was cleaner than most and smelled decent. Shower was a typical low-pressure hotel shower,nothing special. SAT on the edge of the bed for a moment and thought it was going to cave in.

Text: The outside of the building had me worried about the inside. Which wasn't half bad. The shower head was set very low which we found strange. The free breakfast consisted of what tasted like 3 day old coffee, some sort of little Debbie snack she handed us from the freezer, cereal and a waffle iron with no waffle mix.
