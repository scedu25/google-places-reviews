Home Town Inn

Text: No cold water both cats are the same warm temperature, no toilet paper dispenser just single roll sitting on the counter of extremely thin rice paper quality. Dated aged old carpet with stains but it did have comfortable beds and it did have a microwave and fridge. Still overpriced for the value at $70 rooms with the taxes making almost 100?
