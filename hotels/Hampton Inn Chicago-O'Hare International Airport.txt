Hampton Inn Chicago-O'Hare International Airport

Text: Nice place friendly staff. Free shuttles to and from airport 24/7. The continental breakfast is good. Has a waffle maker. Room gave me lice. (Yes, I verified no one else I know has lice. Checked every possible place it could have been. The only possible place I picked it up is from the hotel.) Overall I'd stay again but will bring my own pillow and get entirely clean fresh bedding once I'm in the room.

Text: Nice clean hotel with comfortable beds. Staff was friendly and breakfast was very good. I was concerned about how close it was to the airport, but did not hear any planes flying over. Would stay here in the future.

Text: We found a good deal on Hotel Tonight. Unfortunately when we arrived the staff could not locate the reservation. After twenty minutes or so they did check us in, but that was unnecessary. Young women at counter did do their best to help us. Room was suitable, and the free breakfast was fresh and tasty and plentiful.

Text: Convenient to ORD with complimentary shuttle between hotel and the airport. Not close to downtown, if that's your true destination. Great staff, good breakfast. Small but comfortable room.
