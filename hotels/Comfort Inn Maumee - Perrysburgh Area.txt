Comfort Inn Maumee - Perrysburgh Area
Rating: 5
Text: The Comfort Inn was really quiet nice. The rooms appear to have been updated recently. Everything was clean and in really good condition; nice, modern designs. The front desk receptionist was amazing and provided excellent recommendations for dinner and the movie theater and explained all of the normal things that you seem to have to hunt for at times (WiFi information, pool, breakfast area, etc). The breakfast was good for a continental breakfast with two different types of waffle batter to choose from as well as biscuits and gravy. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom was clean with good shower pressure and temperature. I really don't have anything negative to say about this hotel. I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling through this area as it was extremely easy to get to from the Interstate.

Text: This is a nice hotel in it's price range.  Clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful.  It is near stores, service centers and restaurants.  
I would stay there again were I in the neighborhood.

Text: Location was great. Rooms were clean and staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaints are that the towels were extremely stiff and there was a transport vehicle parked in front of the building all day making it difficult to navigate the driveway.

Text: Good location and clean.  I can count on the comfortable bed and nice pillows, which is why I choose Comfort Inn for some of my travels. Accomodations are usually exceptional, in this price range .  This facility is older and  has older furniture, but is pretty nice for a 2-3 star hotel.  My customer service experience was better here, than my stay at The Renaissance a few months ago in Chicago.
