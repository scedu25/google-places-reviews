Text: Great hotel!  Be careful--as of late September 2017 they are undergoing a renovation.  Parking is limited due to construction, but the hotel staff is very friendly and rooms are clean.  I stay here any time I'm in Rolla.

Text: I had 5 days of work training in a conference room at this hotel. They were ndergoing renovations, which is fine, but there was inconsistent access to restrooms due to the construction. This is something important you should provide your customers.

Text: Have stayed here several times. Out of all the hotels in Rolla, this one is probably the nicest/newest. My rooms have always been clean, staff is helpful and friendly. Close enough to university.

Text: Polite front desk staff that provided fast service when I needed a place to sleep last-minute. Bed was comfy, shower was hot, and breakfast was good. Not much more you can ask for when you need a quick brake from driving all day.
