Text: 2 star review only because of cargo train running almost every hour through out the night and blowing it's horn the whole time!  No sleeping here!  It's a shame because this is a very nice, clean place to stay.  Would not stay again.  Not recommended for light sleepers!

Text: Friendly staff. Clean rooms. Very basic cont. breakfast. Nice surroundings. Hot tub set up outside, for the very brave, this time of year. Nice outdoor grill for all to use.

Text: Really clean, comfortable place with a friendly staff. We sought this place out for the eclipse and it's really the only show in town (almost). So our choice was limited, BUT such a nice choice. Nothing special, but really nice. I'd stay here again.

Text: Outdoor hot tub,. Full length mirror, Grill. What more could a girl want.  Refreshed after our luxury stay we are back on the road. Stopping over at sister Chris' s in Louisville then Zuma or bust. I came armed with nasal mist and various remedies to ward off my altitude ataxia. Ready to stare down the 10, 000 foot challenge

Text: Clean, value hotel. Decent price for a good room with a restaurant right next door. Decent Continental plus breakfast. Only major draw back is the train horn every once in awhile.
