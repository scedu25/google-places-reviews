WaterBird Lakeside Inn

Text: Although you don't get breakfast or a kitchen, you do get a huge room with a balcony that overlooks a pretty dope lake covered in lily pads. I had a great time sitting on the balcony and minding my own business while I watched the wildlife. The lake is beautiful in its own way at night and you don't have a huge porch light to blind you all night. No cameras on the balconies either so you don't feel like you are constantly being watched while you are out there.

Text: I wish I could do a 3.5. The room was large and the hot tub/spa tub was also large. The deck was nice to look at the wildlife in the lake. The working fireplace was very nice. The couch was gross and needs replaced. It had a microwave and refrigerator and chairs with a small end table. Overall I was pleased, the pros of the stay overrode the cons. If they just invested a bit more in the place I think it could be 5 stars.

Text: It's one of the few places in the belt of Indiana by the great lake that allows pets. They could be so much more than what it is. Santa beautiful little Lake but the hotel is not well taken care of. So if you have a pet other than a service pack this is the place to stay all's I can say is read reviews on any place in that area.

Text: The staff was kind and helpful. Cost was reasonable and location convenient. The rooms were clean but felt aged. They did appear to be doing renovations. Overall we were very happy with our stay and would use them again.
