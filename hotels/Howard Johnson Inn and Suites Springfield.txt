Howard Johnson Inn and Suites Springfield
Rating: 2
Text: We got bumped from a king suite to a double room. They said they'd take $15 off our bill for the inconvenience and we still paid over $100 for one night. Definitely not worth it. The bathroom wasn't very clean and there were only 3 pillows for 2 beds. Breakfast was a joke. I understand the term "continental Breakfast" but this wasnt even worth leaving the room for. One waffle maker which we couldn't get near because of a huge long line of people wanting waffles. I had a muffin and my husband had a bagel then we went out to breakfast. I definitely would never stay here again.

Text: Clean room, hot water, lots of tv stations. I stayed in a king suite which was very roomy. Nice continental breakfast with waffles, fruit, cereal, toast, coffee and tea. Fine place to stay for one night while enjoying the fair.

Text: The Chinese lady cuss me out. Call the owner and as I calmly talking to him. Threaten to call the police on me. While he was on the phone because she thought it was OK to cuss out kids that wasn't even mines and I told her she was wrong and should talk to the parents and not the kids.

Text: Not the typical Howard Johnson, it was 2 other names at one time, but nice spacious rooms and front desk very courteous and helpful. Located right off route 29. Near Airport. Restaurants not far away

Text: The bed and bathroom we're clean however the carpet was coming up in spots, the television was set to vh1 (love and hip hop reunion to be exact) and there was no remote in the room. After telling the housekeeping crew that I didn't need service they stood at my door staring at me and then returned 30 minutes later and didn't even knock.
