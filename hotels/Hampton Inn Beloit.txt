Text: Easy access from highway. Very clean. Extremely comfortable beds. I wanted to keep the comforter, it was heavenly. Brand new tiled bathroom with tub. Lovely service at the front desk. Yummy, warm cookies at night upon arrival. Nice breakfast with hot and cold. Swimming pool although i didn't use it. Restaurants within easy walking distance and Aldi across the street.
