Text: We camped here for a week while touring around for the covered bridges in the area.  This place is great.  Quiet and so close to Rockville, which was nice.  Our only complaint is they have only one shower house with only two showers per side.  This is a problem on weekends, for sure.  Also, the hot water runs out pretty fast.  Other than that, very nice.
