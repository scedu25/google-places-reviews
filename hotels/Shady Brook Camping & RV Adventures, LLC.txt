Text: If you want to get away for the weekend and escape the city this is the place to be!! Very convenient location right off the interstate.  I highly recommend Shady Brook Camping & RV Adventures to family and friends!! If you've got a camper, RV, tent, or want to stay in the Awesome Cabin, or try out the Floating Bed they've got it all!! Kids will love it also and have a blast!!

Text: Our getaway to Shady Brook was Amazing! The floating bed is the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. The people are great, camps have a very serene setting and the stars are breathtaking at night! We recommend the trip to Earlham, you will not be disappointed! ?
