Happy O's Sportsman's Resort
Rating: 5
Text: We just stayed here over Memorial weekend. Everywhere was already booked and I happened to call and snag a spot for our fifth wheel, which is huge and not super easy to get in/out of places. We had the best experience! The owner greeted us and checked in with us daily, just to ensure we were happy and had everything we needed. The people who are locals and live in the area, nearby are all so kind. The boat ramp was close, easy to access, and perfect for being able to keep our boat on the water while we were there. This is an older sports camp, and not everything is still in working condition. However, if you are looking for a more private area with impeccable management, this is your spot. We truly feel like we lucked out and instead of dealing with State Park and the local Corps campgrounds, this is where our family will be visiting when we come to the lake! Thank you!

Text: BEWARE!!! Random people opening the deck door (which didn't lock) in the middle of the night. The owner admitted to entering our room while we weren't there! (Violation) We were supposed to be receiving a refund which we are yet to see ( 4 weeks later). I have turned them in to every possible officiant I can think of! This place should be SHUT DOWN!!!!
