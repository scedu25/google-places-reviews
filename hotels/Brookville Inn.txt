Text: I feel like if wake up here in a bathtub with my kidneys missing. I also hear that homeless Tom down the street has a better cardboard box then this room. 
But seriously. Don't stay here. It's cheep yes. But I found hair on the sheets so they don't wash them every time. The bathtub was dirty. I found a beer bottle behind the dresser. Just go on to the next town.
