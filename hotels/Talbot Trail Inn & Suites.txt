Talbot Trail Inn & Suites
Rating: 4
Text: The TALBOT TRAIL INN & SUITES is not an expensive fancy 5????? resort style hotel, but for an independently owned & operated place, it's great. The rooms are clean, cozy, comfortable, simple & the staff are very friendly & accommodating... & PET FRIENDLY! Finding a place like this is becoming fewer & far between!

Text: My wife and I were very impressed with the Talbot Trail. It was very clean, modern and the staff is very friendly. The next time we go back to Leamington, we will be staying there again...!! Ken and Candy Swanson

Text: Best motel I've been in terms of quality of rooms. Our room was spacious and AC was running great. However one minor thing is that some towels weren't clean. But I'd visit again if I go to that area.

Text: We slept well though the facility was quite full. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable but did not use the shower/tub as it was not clean. Must take care and be patient with parking as the lot has only one entrance. Staff were friendly. Would likely stay again.

Text: As we entered the room we were automatically hit by bad decor and  nauseating smell. The place had sort old vibe-isa design with a poor selection of colors. The bath was dirty. And the worse part was that they promised us an lake  view, but all we saw was buildings and cars.  As it had seemed they cheated us since we had to pay around 200$-300$ and most of the rooms were sold for 79$-80$
