Text: O stars would be more like it.Drug central check local paper usually in once a month or more.Manager will lie to your face and not rent to you if he doesn’t want to and corporate does nothing but try to get you to stay in another Motel 6.Never give them my business again.Daughter and family were refused because smoke detector went off in a smoking room from a vapor cig.Fire Dept.Called and did not come.Manager lied said they told him he could get sued if he rented to them again.I called fire dept.and was told they did NOT tell him that.However he has people there renting out there rooms to housekeeping and Bob Evans to get high on breaks.The only reason my daughter stayed there is no vehicle and needed to be close to work.They caused no problems just needed a place they could afford and get to work.

Text: The staff were not friendly, carpets were filthy, the faucet handle was loose and the light over the sink would not come on, outlets were not working, it was overpriced for what it was. I would have stayed 3 months if all those things would have been working and they would have given me a better deal, I stayed a week instead, The place had not been maintained in 20 years it looked like. The tv was from the 90s

Text: We recently stayed in a Motel 6 on Hester Dr. in White House Tennessee. We stayed in smoking room so the smell was somewhat expected. The stains on the both bedspreads, one of the beds had hair on the pillows, the light switch by the sink was sticky with grime was not expected. We were left with less than 1/4 roll of toilet paper with no refill in sight and no tissues. Next overnight stay for us will definitely not be at a Motel 6.

Text: Only complaint was the condition of the room...I understand they are in the process of renovation. Would like to visit again after the remodel is complete.

Text: The hotel was old and pretty clean but pretty out dated.  The biggest problem was that we had two non-smoking rooms and although an oxidizer was used, the mattresses and pillows still smelled like smoke when you laid down on them.  They needed to replace all of the mattresses and pillows and the air filters in the air conditioning units to make me believe it was really a non smoking room.
