Big Locust Farm Bed and Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We enjoyed a wonderful stay there last night. We had the two downstairs rooms with a sitting room. Glenda greeted us warmly and helped us find a great place for dinner. The rooms are clean and very comfortable, the house beautifully decorated with antiques that have been in her family. The grounds are serene and pleasant. Breakfast was delicious and the conversation with Glenda made it even better. She was a great resource, pointing us to Hemlock Cliffs when we asked about hiking and activities. We would happily stay here again and would recommend it without hesitation.
