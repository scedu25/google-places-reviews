Carlisle Inn Walnut Creek
Rating: 5
Text: We have been staying here for about 15 years. The rooms are lovely and I notice on this visit that they have updated, in particular the bathrooms, beautiful tile and step in glass enclosure shower. The staff is kind and the views as always are stunning. Come and unplug in Ohio's Amish country, the food, shopping, and quiet peace are refreshing.

Text: If you're looking for quaint, quiet and relaxing, the Carlisle In Walnut Creek is the place.  We come here at least once a year to experience the beautiful amenities, gorgeous countryside and wonderful people.  Staff bend over backwards to make your visit wonderful and the scenery helps melt the stress away.
