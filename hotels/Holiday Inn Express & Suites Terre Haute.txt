Holiday Inn Express & Suites Terre Haute
Rating: 5
Text: The front desk attendant was very attentive, friendly and remembered my amenity points. The lobby and breakfast areas were clean and well-appointed. My room was bigger than ordinary and had a kitchenette. I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste, so I was able to get those at the front desk at no charge. The bed left a little bit to be desired, but was comfortable enough to sleep in. The room was clean and smelled clean as well. Overall it was a really good night stay.

Text: These people love their fax machine. Other than that the room was great. Front desk staff was helpful - or at least as helpful as hotel regulations would allow them to be. Located conveniently in Terra Haute. Bookshop and Panda Express nearby, with a mall and a handful of other things nearby.

Text: Really was clean and modern hotel, while the staff was friendly and super helpful. Amenities were nice. The Free Breakfast was delicious with plenty of options. Pet friendly, and the staff even was so helpful to watch over my dog for a little bit while I had to run out. 5 stars for sure. Places like this reminded me of what a great hotel experienced should be like. Even compared to when staying at a more re-known or downtown-like hotel. Just a great experience, and I'd highly recommend.

Text: This is by far the nicest Holiday Inn and for that matter any other road trip hotel we have ever stayed in. It is beautifully decorated and outfitted much nicer than average. Our room was very neat and clean and also peaceful and quiet. The front desk was very helpful with reservation snafu and we were very grateful for their help in straightening it out. We will definitely stay there again
