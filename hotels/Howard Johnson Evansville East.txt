Text: Wonderful stay. Our room was convenient especially with our dog. The only thing was the pool was very green. They closed it off the morning we checked out to maintain it. Breakfast is amazing!

Text: This place is extremely nice and very reasonable on cost. We stay here frequently. They are currently remodeling and they've chosen a very modern look for the hotel. I love the colors. The staff here is friendly, the breakfast is great and our overall experience is fantastic!

Text: My son and I stayed here night before last due to work being done on my home. We checked in late and only slept in the room. My son got bitten by bedbugs in the few hours we stayed at this location. To be fair, I have stayed here several times in the past few months with the repairs to the house and never had a problem. I called the hotel to report the issue today, since I wasn't aware of it until late last night, and was told that if I didn't report it at the time if my stay too bad. Really?? Too bad. I never complain about things and I've stayed several times, yet my child is bitten by bed bugs and I get too bad. If course they wanted to know what room. Although this may be petty on my part, I did not tell them. Maybe they have called id and can use that, maybe they'll have to refund other guests instead of just me. Good luck to them.
