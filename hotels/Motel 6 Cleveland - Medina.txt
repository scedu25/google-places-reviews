Motel 6 Cleveland - Medina
Rating: 1
Text: I scheduled for a two room bed online. When I went to the hotel the clerk said why did you schedule two beds if you are just one person and changed it to one bed. I wanted two beds because there is more room. I stayed in a room with one small bed, which was very uncomfortable. There was a landscape crew there that was there very late and made tons of noise. The room was worse than my hospital room when I had my last son. Will never go back.

Text: The room was very clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable and it was peaceful there. I would stay again when in the area. Very good service.

Text: Everything was really good. Very friendly staff. I have stayed at this Motel 6 numerous times (at least a dozen times..if not more) The reason I keep coming back is because of the hospitality from beginning to end. Rooms are clean..the pool is nice. The ONLY reason I don't give it a five star is the hot tub has not worked in years...i can tell because the hot tub is showing rust and that is not a good sight. Other than that..as always a great stay!

Text: It nice to be able to get room at fair price. My husband was having his sleep study at this hotel so was nice to get room here for a great price. The people was nice. And the rooms was clean. The rooms are not fancy with micowave and little refrigerator but for a one night stay it was okay. I did miss having breakfast in the morning because most hotel have breakfast food that you can get. If we need to stay up there again I would pick it.

Text: We had a good experience. The pool was a great wind down for my daughter. The staff was very pleasant and friendly. The local discounts were great! Only thing I would recommend was to put sound boards in the room as we had to listen to the neighbors tv all night!
