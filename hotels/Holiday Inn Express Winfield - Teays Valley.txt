Text: I don't know why but this places hot tub is usually under some type of maintenance. I always like their front desk person. They are always nice. The room service and housecleaning are also nice and will try to get you what you need. I like the pool and this hotel is right off the interstate exit.

Text: The service was great. The included breakfast in the morning was better than most hotel breakfasts, including warm cinnamon rolls. Currently, there is construction going on in the hotel, but other than seeing a few workers, you couldn't really tell.

Text: The front desk people were nice and the breakfast was on par for a decent hotel breakfast, the beds were comfy and the tv service was nice with plenty of channels.  Only reason this is a 3 star is because of the old floors, weak and unresponsive internet and some odd smells.  The floors look like they've seen a lot and haven't been changed for a few decades.  See pictures for reference, this seems to be the standard for most rooms.  But it does appear they're refurbishing the place

Text: We were placed in a room, which we found out first thing the next morning, was directly adjacent to a room undergoing construction.  We woke up quite earlier than planned Sunday to hammering, scraping, and intermittent use of power tools.  I'm astounded that any hotel would deem it acceptable to book a room sharing a wall with a room which is under construction.
