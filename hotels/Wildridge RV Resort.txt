Wildridge RV Resort

Text: Been going here for a decade or more. It has its positives and negatives.  Always something fun going on like chili cook-off, bingo, swimming, or just being a lot lizard on the golf cart.  Also has issues like lack of Wi-Fi signal if you aren't near the park/pool, drainage issues during heavy rain, and people letting kids too young to drive troll around on golf carts.  It's something to do.  Basically a middle class trailer park
