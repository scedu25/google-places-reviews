Hampton Inn & Suites Radcliff/Fort Knox
Rating: 3
Text: Hotel was situated outside of town, not too conveniently located. The steakhouse across the street had ok food which made that less critical. The front desk staff was helpful but room keys we were given did not work and had to be replaced. The AC unit in the room did not work well and was loud, the curtains would not shut all the way so there was a lot of light in the room all night. The room and hotel hallways smelled faintly of mildew and carpet shampoo. Not a bad hotel for one night passing through, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything longer.

Text: The breakfast bar open at 6:00 am. I get there at 6:00 and the food was cold. No way 2 heat it up.  So I tired the oats little warm. Why do u use such cheap toilet paper & Kleenex?  U wouldn't except that from Hilton Hotels.  I what 2 give a shout out 4 Andrea the night manager. She goes out of her way 2 please us when we stay there. U need more people like her. Andrea is a God sent.I'm always glad when she is there 2 help us.

Text: The hotel was very clean, staff was very accommodating and professional during our stay.  Andrea C. went above and beyond to make sure our stay at this hotel was enjoyable. The continental breakfast fell short on variety but besides that our stay there was nice.

Text: Only a few years old. Very nice, clean. Had a king bed room where the bed faced the window. Big room, bigger bathroom. There is a great steak restaurant right in front of the hotel. 10%disc with your room key or military.
