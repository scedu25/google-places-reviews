The Alexander Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: The hotel is beautiful with spacious rooms and friendly staff. My father has a crazy coffee addiction and the front desk and housekeeping staff have all been very nice about resupplying him with k-cups as needed. I've also really enjoyed the fruit infused water available in the lobby. Overall, it's been a lovely hotel experience.

Text: Excellent experience at this hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel itself was centrally located. Rooms were spacious and well designed, with comfortable beds and furniture. The decor was lovely, with beautiful artwork and design touches throughout. Also had a great experience at the bar, world class cocktails served by friendly staff in a unique setting. Highly recommended.

Text: My mother and I totally splurged on a 1 night stay. We paid $200 a night for 2 nights in June. I wasn't sure it would be worth it. But it totally was. I actually felt this was a LUXURY hotel. Not just in price, not just in furnishing and design, but service and ambiance. Room Service was really good. Loved the menu. The bathroom...omg loved the shower. Loved the furniture. And we had a great view of downtown. They were proudly supportive of Pride (which happened to be during our stay) I like that they celebrate diversity and inclusion. The lobby had a cell phone charging station which I think is very thoughtful and a must in a modern hotel.  I find myself looking for charging stations in other hotels but they're not the norm standard yet.  I couldn't afford to make this my regular hotel but I'd stay here for special occasions.

Text: It felt like I got to spend the night in an art museum! 

When my best friend got us concert tickets for Indy I knew we needed to stay in the area over night and started searching locations near our venue. The Alexander was rated rather high and was the closest to the location.  I booked it cautiously optimistic, as the exterior of the location does not do this place justice!

The staff was extremely welcoming and made sure all our questions were answered. Our receipts were emailed to us, making check-in and check-out a smooth and quick process.

Our room was spacious and very clean, the bed was very comfortable.  There was a fridge and coffee pot with lots of drink options. The room was quiet with very little outside disturbances.

The BEST part is that was SO BEAUTIFUL. There was art work everywhere you looked. There were urban spray-painted installations in the parking garage, techno sounding music/screen piece in the walkway to the hotel and so, so many more works all over the hotel. Many of the works were so clever I was blown away.  And when I was having trouble winding down and not able to sleep (no fault of the hotels, I just have trouble sleeping in new places) I had a visual feast walking the hotel.

We didn't get a chance to check out the restaurant or mixology bar, but look forward to it the next time we stay. Oh, Yes, We will be staying again. This is the bar that I will be judging all of my further hotel accommodations from now on!

Text: This is my 2nd visit to this hotel and both times I received Stellar treatment from the staff. It has several excellent places to relax. The lobby area is filled with all kinds of beautiful art and natural surfaces and comfortable seating to have a conversation. The lobby restaurant / bar is incredibly comfortable. The rooms are spectacular and the food served in each area was fantastic! There's nothing better than a totally satisfying experience at a hotel, especially when all you're doing is having a meeting or two.
