Text: Beautiful property, well kept. Very good breakfast with a good variety to choose from. Only problem, leave your valuables at home. Things can go missing, even out of your suitcase! Apparently, this place is located in the heart of meth country and now I know that.

Text: I'm giving it 1 star for there lobby staff and management because it is a very nice hotel, they have no sympathy for a tired exhausted traveler that had a long bad day.  They acted like I was a burden to them for looking for a room to rest, you're in the hospitality business? That is all.

Text: Had a great stay in a first floor suite. Rooms were nice and clean and it was very quiet for a sold out hotel. Not much around it but staff was great and I would stay again if I was in the area.

Text: This hotel is excellent. I have no idea what its rated as a two star hotel. The prices are reasonable and the room I stayed in was the most confortable hotel room Ive ever experienced. Kitchen to make food if your an extended say, nice bathrooms, good interior design, paint scheme.
