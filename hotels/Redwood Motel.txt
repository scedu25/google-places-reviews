Redwood Motel
Rating: 4
Text: It was a little old but it wasn't expensive so it worked really well. Also the couple who own the place are unbelievably amazing. Location is great because it is a 2 minute walk from the bar which is very helpful.

Text: a little old with a rustic style but couldn't ask for a better place to stay. The owners are good and friendly people, and reflect what hospitality should be, ( to bad they can't bottle it and sell it.
