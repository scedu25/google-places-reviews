North Outlet Park

Text: I have been going here since I was a young lad. The fishing had slowed a little, but it is still a good time. Don't forget your drop nets to pull the big ones up the wall. I deer hunt this area (rifle and bow) every year and can't imagine myself going anywhere else. It has become a family tradition with my father and brothers. 

This park is great year round and I will add a few summer pictures after my next visit.
