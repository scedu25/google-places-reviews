Sisson's Country Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Huge rooms with lots of beds, friendly hosts who know the area well, very good breakfasts.  Guests have access to own kitchen, dining room, fireplace.  Family friendly.  We had a great time!

The B & B is in rural area surrounded by farms, but  less than 10 miles from the Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge; shops and restaurants in Havana IL; Dickson Mounds archaeological museum; and stables with horse riding lessons for kids.  Lots to do even in the middle of winter.

Text: My two brothers and I stayed here on a bike trip this past week, and were very satisfied with our stay. First, we arrived earlier than we had expected, and hadn't had dinner. Donna Sisson volunteered to drive us to Havana, and do some errands while we had dinner at a diner. Then she gave us a ride the ten miles back to the house. They also had washing machines and dryers, which we used to wash and dry our clothes. Our room was spacious and the beds were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was large and clean. There was a kitchen adjacent to our room, where we used the spare refrigerator and microwave, and a living room where we we just relaxed and talked. In the morning, she got up at 5:30 AM to make us biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, juice, and coffee, so that we could get out by 7 AM. Before we left, she asked if she could take our photos, and then she gave us each a goodbye hug, and wished us a safe journey. The level of friendliness and hospitality reminded us of staying at our grandmother's house. I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again.

Text: I spent two nights here in August, 2013. Highly recommended in all aspects.
The innkeepers are lovely people, will definitely come back again.The price is about half of the amount you would pay anywhere else at a B&B. Great outdoors opportunities nearby, especially fishing, hunting. I was biking in the countryside, all farm roads are PAVED, no traffic. Enjoy the slideshow that will show you around.
