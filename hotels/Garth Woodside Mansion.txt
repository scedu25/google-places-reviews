Text: Thank you so much Julie and John.  We had our daughters small family wedding today. And it was a wonderful day. Julie and John did a great job. The decorations were simple and elegant. We were very happy. The meal was excellent, can't say enough! Julie is a easy person to work with. I will highly recommend the mansion to anyone I know looking for a great venue.

Text: My family and I stopped by to take some pictures of the historic mansion. The house and grounds were beautiful! The caretaker also brought out the Llamas for my 9 and 10 y/o daughters to feed. Cool place. The only drawback is that my Stepfather fell down due to a step, on the main sidewalk, that had no sign alerting people to watch their step. In the bright mid day sun, the step isn't visible. It looks like 1 continuous sidewalk.

Text: Beautiful house for a bed and breakfast. The house has a lot of the original furniture that seems to have been kept in great condition so there's definitely a lot of history here. It's run by a lovely older couple who are very accommodating. The breakfast was delicious as well; we had fresh fruit, freshly baked muffins, and breakfast quiches (I think they change up the menu everyday too). Overall, we had an amazing time here.

Also, there are llamas and alpacas out back that you can feed carrots!!

Text: What an amazing place!  There is nothing else like this. Original antique furnishings, and modern amenities. Owners John and Julie are the perfect hosts. The breakfasts are incredible! And yes, Mark Twain stayed here many times while visiting the original owner. This is a one of a kind opportunity to experience turn of the century elegance! It is a must stay.

Text: I stayed here with my girlfriend on our trip down to Marti Gras.  We arrived a little late, but the hosts were more than accommodating, they even offered a nice nightcap when we arrived.  A plus that you don't get with many BNBs is that you can use the hot tub anytime during the day, even past 10pm.  If we're in the area again, we'll definitely be repeat customers.
