Courtyard by Marriott Lafayette

Text: Great night stay there. Newly furnished and renovated. Comfy, clean bed. Polite, helpful staff. Only complaint is the shower had poor pressure, as the head was heavily calcified. Otherwise clean. Would highly recommend!

Text: Well kept.  Great staff.  Although the manager should lighten up a bit.  Gave a new employee a little too much grief over a very minor issue when I checked in.

Text: I have stayed at this Courtyard twice now, and have had great experiences both times. I find this to be a pretty good hotel for those visiting students. While the location is a bit far from Purdue, it is very convenient that the shuttles from IND drop off at the hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the lobby, cafe, and hotel are very nice for working and relaxing. There is also an outdoor area, but I have not been there. The rooms are very modern and clean - quite a comfortable place to spend the night. Overall, I enjoy the more modern feel of this hotel and would certainly recommend it to my friends.
