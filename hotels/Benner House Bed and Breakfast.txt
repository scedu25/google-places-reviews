Text: Not a B&B!  Room Only.  House has good bones but needs lots of work And Cleaning.  Great location.  Nice walk to downtown.

Text: Warning: this establishment is apparently no longer a bed and breakfast.  It is merely a bed. I have no idea who this Sheri is that all the other reviewers are referring to but she is evidently no longer there.  Everything is handled through the St. George Hotel a few blocks down the street.  There is no on site host and there are still signs posted everywhere about breakfast. No warning about this situation was given to me at any stage of the booking.  I even called the St. George Hotel about this and was dumped into a answering service and my call was NEVER returned. Makes me wonder what would happen if you actually had an emergency.

The house has a very odd abandoned feeling to it. Unread mail is piling up, the refrigerator did not appear to have been cleaned in some time.  I was afraid to even try the pool or hot tub that were still covered outside and did appear to have been used in some time.

It is a cool old house though I don't approve of the design choices but I feel the pictures represent that aspect well.

Text: Location was great. Very old house that is able to host a lot of people. Parts of the house seemed a little unstable but nothing too bad. Seemed a little pricey for what was there, however being in walking distance was very convenient.

Text: The benner house is no longer a bed and breakfast although the rates are premium. It is under new off site management. Sherry is gone. The place felt abandoned. No breakfast, no coffee maker, no maid service, no fresh towels. Hot tub was swampy. We had box elder beetles in our room. Lots of them. Hope they get it together. A lovely property.
