Text: Lovely. Location is good, near restaurant and Cosmosphere. Parking lot is kinda small, but big enough. Great rooms, perhaps best I've ever had. Great breakfast. Very recommended.

Text: Great spot to stay in the Hutchison area. The hotel is newer and has a modern look and feel. The hotel staff is very attentive and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and have HD channels. Typical free continental breakfast and they do offer other snacks, beverages including wine for purchase near the front desk. One thing I didn't like was how they left your bill tapped to the door instead of slipping it under. Information is xxx  out but it still feels unsafe for other guests to know first initial characters in an email address and just the sheer fact someone is still on their room....

Text: The hotel is nice, and staff is friendly. But the beds are the absolute stiffest. Worst sleep I almost had. Concrete would have bee better. Seriously going to have to visit the doctor after this.

Text: Room and hotel clean but forget the pet friendly. For one night we were charged 75 dollars for a 7 pound dog whereas the room was 108 for 3 adults. Site with making reservation never stated cost for a pet and I was not informed. Go figure that a small dog cost just as close to 3 dogs. Pet owners beware!!!
