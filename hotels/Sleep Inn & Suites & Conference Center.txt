Text: Great value. Room was clean, quiet, and well appointed. Staff was courteous and prompt. Definitely a hotel that we would stop to stay at again when traveling through the area.

Text: Very nice hotel and the clerk at the front desk was super helpful. She gave us some advice about a frozen yogurt place and also offered to help with a reservation that wasn't quite right. We are travelling by motorcycle and they allowed us to park under the front awning where it was on camera security so bikers here is a good place to stay.
