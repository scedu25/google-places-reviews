Holiday Inn Express & Suites Lexington-Downtown/University
Rating: 4
Text: Check in was quick and the staff was friendly. The room was clean, but I found it strange that a ground floor room had no black out curtains. The breakfast was well stocked and the coffee wasn't always full.

Text: I had to stay overnight in Lexington Ky to have a heart procedure done at St. Joseph Hospital. Of course my husband, son & myself stayed @ the Holiday Inn Express. The room was clean & comfortable as always. Staff was professional, neat & kind. This hotel is my favorite & we will be repeat customers for years to come. Thank You to the owners & staff.
