Ramada Louisville North
Rating: 5
Text: Had a great stay here. The room was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The continental breakfast was also good. Test location was great it seemed like everywhere we went in Louisville was only 15 minutes or so away. Would definitely stay here again.

Text: So the hotel is pretty nice. It's very comfortable, the room is okay, there's parking like right outside our room so we don't have to go far from the car to the room. There's a free continental breakfast and there is a pool. The only issue I have is the continental breakfast doesn't contain much in the way of protein. It's mostly bread and bread based items. That's it. Everything else is good.

Text: Our room was modern and very clean. The pool was very nice. Loved the fact that there was a bar/restaurant. Customer service was excellent. Best part was that it was located directly next to the festival we were attending.

Text: We traveled to Louisville to experience the Solar Eclipse. We weren't spending much time at the hotel so we chose the Ramada. The first room smelled of stale cigarette smoke as if it had been a smoking room at one time and never cleaned. We were given another room immediately. Aside of the inconvenience of it, it was no big deal. The new room was perfectly clean. Can't beat an inexpensive poolside room with complimentary breakfast that we were able to bring our little seven pound dog along on our road trip!

Text: Reasonably priced, rather clean. Staff seemed nice. There is a Mexican Restaurant attached which made dinner easy. Room was very humid even with AC. Bathroom tub/shower did not drain.
