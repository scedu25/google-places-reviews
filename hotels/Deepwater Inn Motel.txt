Deepwater Inn Motel
Rating: 4
Text: Awesome staff who will make you feel like you're at home (without the work.) Nice, clean rooms with comfortable beds. Great view of lake and boat launch/marina adjacent to motel. Nice little pool, great for kids. A/C was  a bit sketchy in some rooms but all units are supposed to be upgraded soon.

Text: We got a great price on our room. 2 beds, cable tv and there is a pool outside. There is a mini fridge and a microwave in the room, which was very useful to my wife and our 3 kids while I was at a class all day. There is also a coin laundry room and a great view of the lake. Highly recommend to people looking for a nice motel in the lake area.
