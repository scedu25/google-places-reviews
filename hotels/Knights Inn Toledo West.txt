Text: This hotel was not clean! Hair (all kinds of hair if you know what I mean) all over the bath tub. Drug dealer and working women all though out the night. We quest for the maintenance man to fix air conditioning and bed changed this was not taking car of. The door locked stoped working asked maintenance to fix it on a Friday and wasn't not fixed until Monday so we had to ask permission to get in are room. The maintenance will ask you for beer a cigarette as he picking up half smoked cigarettes of the ground smoking them. The working women will ask you for stuff. The manger says he cares and will take care of stuff but won't. He lies and promise stuff but don't do it. It's not worth the time or money for the hotel. I felt unsafe staying here and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Text: The place was OK the rooms were clean and nice but the bathrooms are small and they need to have a flat screen TV

Text: Either fix the damn Wi-fi or remove the posting "Free Wi-fi". Can't do any work on laptop. What an absolute joke!  Stains on the chair. Weatherstripping coming off door.
