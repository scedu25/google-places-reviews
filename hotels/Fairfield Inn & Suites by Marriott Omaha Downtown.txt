Text: Awesome receptionist the evening of 10/28/17. She was so friendly, welcoming and patient with us. We had booked our room for the wrong day and she made everything go so smooth and well and fixed our error for us. Room was great nice and clean. Staff was very friendly. Very happy with our stay!

Text: This location was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The shuttle service was convenient to get around, a valuable service when the hotel was a little bit from downtown. Room was clean and quiet. No complaints. Definitely recommended.

Text: Great hotel with nice rooms and a hot breakfast. Easy walk from the Century link for concerts and there are some restaurants in the area for food. Didn't go swimming but the pool looked nice with a hot tub. It's in a nice part of town too.

Text: The room is clean but there is absolutely no parking available and there seem to be a lot of homeless people everywhere surrounding the hotel. From the photos the pool looks average size for an indoor pool. I am currently at the pool and it is very crowded. There are 6 kids and 4 adults and there is barely elbow room between everyone.

Text: The room was very clean and well made. Great sized bathroom and mirror, perfect for getting ready for a night on the town with the girls. Breakfast wasnt too bad, a nice variety of options.
