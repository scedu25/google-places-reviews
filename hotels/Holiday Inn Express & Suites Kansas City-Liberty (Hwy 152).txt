Holiday Inn Express & Suites Kansas City-Liberty (Hwy 152)

Text: Location was good. The breakfast was very nice. The room was clean and comfortable, if a little dated. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The kids loved playing in the pool. The bathroom had poor ventilation and got very steamy and muggy even with the fan on, and the water escaped all over the floor despite the shower curtain. My son slipped and fell twice during his shower, but he wasn't hurt. Maybe some better grips on the floor would be helpful? We would stay here again as overall it was very relaxing and comfortable and the price was good.

Text: Stayed one night in a one king bed room. Had a midnight check in. Women working was super nice and very helpful. Excellent experience and an even better price!

Text: Everyone we talked to was super friendly and very helpful. Even with we needed so many extra blankets and pillows! Always someone on hand, and happy to help. The complimentary breakfast was only so-so, but I'm not complaining.

It's what's inside that counts! Pleasantly surprised! Friendly front desk, as well as the on-sight staff. Cookies, coffee and lemon water in lobby area. It seems like an older hotel that's been updated. Very CLEAN. Good free breakfast!  I love how attentive the person in charge of the dining area was and she was very friendly. Plenty of free parking. BUT my most favorite and most important part of all  was THE BED!!! Wow! I have been to very nice hotels and slept, or more like, not been able to sleep, in extremely uncomfortable beds with extremely uncomfortable pillows. I knew once I laid down on this bed and my head hit the pillow there would be hope for a good night's sleep and for the 1st time EVER I; #1slept through the night and #2woke up without any bodyaches and pains or headaches! Now that is huge, I mean HUGE for me! I will definitely save this location in my notes!!!

Text: No complaints really, everything was perfectly adequate, but the rooms were a little pricey for that quality level.
