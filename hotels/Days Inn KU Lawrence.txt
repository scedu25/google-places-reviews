Days Inn KU Lawrence

Text: We had a terrible experience at this hotel. The rooms were dirty, the refrigerators did not work, the curtains in one room fell on my sons head and worst of all, my husband fell on the stairs heavily bruising his shin and arm/shoulder. I complained to the company and spoke with someone from the hotels and their best response was to offer me a discount to come back!!! My advise is; if you have to stay here, be careful on the stairs, the exterior stairs - both staircases- are cracked and have been pained over instead of being repaired. The stairs are crooked and when it rains very very slippery as the tread is angled in different directions due to the breaks in the concrete. Be very careful walking on the stairs. Inside the room, don't use the fridge; we lost our pizza, and the insulin that was supposed to be kept cool was warm/room. Do not touch the curtains as they are not anchored into the wall but just screwed into the drywall. We will not be returning to this hotel and I do not recommend it.

Text: I had left the hotel BY 11:10AM, was packing all of my things when someone knocked on the door. I said 'I will be out in a minute.' realizing that it was literally 11AM... As I was still gathering my things the same guy knocked on the door again, and this time he OPENED THE DOOR ON ME!! I'm not sure if he speaks English because I was yelling to him that I would be out in a minute and he proceeds to walk into my room and watch me!!!!! Housekeeping? Yeah right. He didn't even have the housekeeping cart with him! I do not recommend staying here. The doors hardly close, everything is broken. The breakfast is a joke. I will not be staying here again. For the $$$ I spent on a room, which was fairly cheap for one night after a concert, their pool was closed, the guy at the front counter hardly spoke English, along with the guy that walked in on me, staring at me. Gross! The next time I come to Lawrence I will most definitely not be staying here!

Text: Paper thin walls. Checked into a room that was already occupied. The bed is comparable to padded floor.

Text: Front staff was good and got .e a room quickly. I had a 1 king size bed room. Overall for being an older building I didn't have any issues.

Text: Definitely been to much nicer Days Inn for maybe $5-$10 more per night. Get what you pay for i suppose. As I'm typing this I feel critters crawling all over my body. Dead spider in the bathroom. Pay the extra money and go somewhere else. I can't even sleep because of all these bugs in the bed. This place is a complete dump!
