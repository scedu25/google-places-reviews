Best Western Plus Springfield Airport Inn
Rating: 4
Text: I always enjoy this location.  They pay for a cab to and from airport.  I really like the big chair and ottoman in the rooms.  It is so comfortable to watch TV or read.  The breakfast food was warm and freshly prepared and they have just about anything you would want.   The ladies at the front desk are friendly and efficient and really make you feel welcome.

Text: Our stay was better than I thought it was going to be. We booked 2 days in advance and this was the only decent hotel that had openings,  lot of events going on in Springfield that weekend. I thought we were going to be way outside of town but it was only 7 miles from family. Not sure why the reviews were not that good, but it was updated, quite, clean and a friendly staff.

Text: Our stay at this Best Western was wonderful! The check in was quick and easy, the room was very clean and well stocked with toiletries. The breakfast was plentiful and offered lots of options. One of the best hotel breakfasts we have had! I highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure travel. The kids enjoyed the indoor pool as well!
