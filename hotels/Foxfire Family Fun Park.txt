Text: We were in need of an extended stay campground for an upcoming high school reunion and to visit relatives on both sides since my wife and I are from the area and graduated from the same high school. The staff worked us in and got us a full hook up shadey spot that was just perfect.

Since our stay was about 3 weeks, we had time to explore the campground, meet some of the long term campers and fish in their catch and release pond. This is a family place and the kids are here having fun and being good, as it should be. Dog friendly too but we haven't replaced our passed dog before this trip.

The staff is the best and they are always maintaining, improving and keeping the place clean and beautiful. My only complaint is the non-adjustable water temperature in the showers. We found them too warm for our liking and used the shower in our motor home. Its a minor thing but it's the only blemish on a really nice campground we found.

Highly recommend this family owned and run campground. It met our needs and the staff is top notch!
