Text: If I could give zero stars I would. Worst customer service. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay in Andover.

Text: We arrived very late, perhaps 2 or 3am after daylight savings and Craig, the manager, was very thoughtful letting us know in advance we could have a late check-out due to our late arrival time. The hotel looks great, newly remodeled, and was very clean inside. We received much needed rest. If you are staying in East Wichita I highly recommend this Motel 6

Text: We loved the people they were nice. Craig was nice when my Aunt and I checked in. The house keeper cleaned our room. The beds were nice and soft. Pillows were fluffy. I would stay there again.
