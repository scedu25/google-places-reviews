Hearthstone Inn & Suites

Text: A friend and I attended a conference in the area and stayed overnight on 10/23-24 in room 205. The room was clean and comfortable, convenient location, and friendly staff. My one disappointment was the breakfast. A hearty breakfast including sausage and eggs was advertised, and was a big reason we paid $117 instead of around $80 for a comparable room elsewhere. What we found was microwavable sausage sandwiches, which in my opinion not the same. They did have juice, cereals, yogurts, and bread choices.

Text: Would have never guessed that a place like this would be in such a little town. Rooms were nice will pointed. Surprisingly the little touches made you feel that your stay was important to the owners. History artifacts in side making it feel like home. Highly recommend.

Text: Just an awesome place! (And I am not just saying this because I have known the owner for over 43 years!!) This place was amazingly built with painstaking attention to every  detail! It incredibly marries the charm,  comfortable feel, affordability, and personal service of a Bed & Breakfast,  with the up-scale amenities of a fine hotel, all in a quaint, picturesque setting! Perfect for a vacation stop over, weekend getaway, or even for a business stay. You will absolutely love it from the moment you cross the threshold! Come and experience one of South Eastern Ohio's most unique Inns and best kept secrets! You'll be glad you did!

Text: Paper thin walls and ceiling. If you enjoy hearing your upstairs neighbor urinating at 5 and 6am, or listening to an hour long conversation of the person in the next room, fine. I don't.

The staff was nice, but at the end of the day, your paying for a place to sleep.

Text: Very pretty Inn. Staff was very nice and helpful. We were happy with the room and breakfast was a nice surprise with quite a variety of options. We'd stay here again!
