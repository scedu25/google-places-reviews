Text: First they charged me 5 dollars more per room when I got there and told me they had booked me at that price even though my price showed 5$ less.  With a team of kids I didn't have much choice day of.  Then that evening one of the kids rooms ceiling started coming down, joist was hanging down about 8-10 inches and had been getting worse.  When we asked them about it, their first response was well we can duct tape it up if it is that big of deal.  It wasn't until I forced their hand that they finally agreed to give us another room and that took almost an hour for them to pull off.  They refused to work with me day of on the price or even discuss it with me.  Then when I finally did reach someone they said they would look at possibly adjusting our price, but said they made no promise and refused to do anything.   It's one thing to have a crappy hotel with holes in the wall and rooms that smell of smoke and sheets with stains on them it is another all together to have poor customer service.  Don't stay here and if you already booked you better cancel and find a new one.

Text: Warning, bait and switch setup when booked through Priceline.  I booked a room here, it said nonsmoking as an amenity.  When I tried checking in I was told I had to pay 30 dollars to upgrade to a non smoking room.  Smoking rooms are all single bed.  Then they stuck me in a room that they said was nonsmoking.  Really, it was a smoking room that hadn't been smoked in for a while because it needed a repair.  Unfortunately, it hadn't been cleaned since the repair was needed either.  There was hair in the bed, dirt on the floor, dirt on the shower floor, and possibly feces on the toilet.

Text: Bed was comfortable and room was clean! Very friendly staff willing to help with anything! Breakfast is good but it would be nice if it lasted beyond 9 AM. They took everything away at 9:05 AM and could've left it out for a few minutes for several people that were a little late. 10 AM would be a good time to stop the breakfast.

Text: Wish I could give less than 1 star. Couldn't even stay in the room that we reserved because it was so filthy, disgustingly dirty. Bedsheets, covers, and blankets were disgustingly dirty and stained. There were roaches, flies, and  roly-poly's all over the floor. The cheap furniture in the room was unusable because it literally felt like it was going to fall apart. The bathroom was horrendous; the showercurtain was stained with what looked to be feces-- no exaggeration. After placing a complaint and requesting a refund, the people who ran the front desk and checked us into the room said the room was clean and not deserving of a refund. Rooms are not as pictured. Don't stay here.
