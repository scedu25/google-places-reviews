Text: What happened to red roofs? Used to be a little upper star. Now all the same as 1 stars. Couldnt get 1st floor room cleaned. Been changed 3 times! Employee brought a table out for bbq....manager made him bring it back in. Must be a "patel" hotel.

Text: Very nice employees. Was greeted politely everytime we came in or left. Had a 1 king bed room was a little small but comfortable. Beds were clean and soft. Didn't get to the pool but it looked nice from just walking by. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in ames.

Text: Front desk was exceptional.  Room was clean but had a lingering smell of stale smoke.  We used air freshener to make it better.  Easy access to the highway and fuel/convenience store!
