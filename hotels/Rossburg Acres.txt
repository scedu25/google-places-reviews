Text: Very nice country setting, and sites are very spacious - only electric / water. Swimming pond looks very nice. Restrooms are ok, but very basic and could be cleaner. The weekend we stayed, music was playing thru the campground speaker, which was annoying when you just wanted to sit around campfire and enjoy peace and quiet of country setting.
