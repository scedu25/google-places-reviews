Text: This hotel has old-fashioned charm and character with modern amenities. Loved the "breakfast room" which is actually open 24 hours. Just help yourself to whatever is in the fridge, just like home. There is good coffee on hand and even better coffee in the cool attached coffee bar. This is an awesome place to stay!
