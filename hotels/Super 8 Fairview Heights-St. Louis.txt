Super 8 Fairview Heights-St. Louis
Rating: 4
Text: Clean room. Smelled fresh. Maintenance needed in room. Phone cord was cut so we couldn't call front desk or get wake up call. Not too big a problem we have cell phones. Shower head sprayer needs replaced or cleaned out for pressure.
Nice friendly people at front desk.
Coffee was good and they kept the breakfast area fresh. 
Bed was comfortable and we slept well.
Safe area.

Text: Booked a King room and was given 2 Queens but this was Priceline's fault and the hotel corrected it. Was also charged for an extra night that was a pain to get refunded but I'm not sure if this was the hotel or Priceline. The staff was all friendly and the room was clean. The only complaint was that the AC unit would turn itself off and the room would be hot when we returned. Great location next to a fitness center, restaurants, shopping and a theater. Just a short 20 minute drive to St. Louis.
