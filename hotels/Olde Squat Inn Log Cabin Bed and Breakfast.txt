Text: I did not stay here, but called to see if there were any rooms available.  The gentleman I spoke with was very rude. He told me the prices on the website were void at this point because apparently a solar eclipse will be occurring the weekend I needed a room.  False advertisement then!  I needed a place to stay in that general area, not everyone is traveling because of a solar eclipse.  I can watch that from my house for free!  He asked me what I wanted to pay and would not give me a price.  Told me when I decided what my budget could handle to give him a call!!!  Are you serious???  I will take my business elsewhere, thank you!  Looks like a fabulous environment, but I guess he wasn't interested in my business.
