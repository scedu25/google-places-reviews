Cameron Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: Good for the price. Had clean rooms and a decent breakfast. Comfortable bed. ? 
Some things in the room and bathroom had been recently updated and others were obviously well worn. 
Rating: 5
Text: This is the best value of any reasonably priced lodging I know of. Better than most higher priced lodging as well. Exceeded my expectations in every way..... super modern clean rooms, excellent beds and linens, beautifully decorated. Great staff. I will never stay at any other inn while traveling through the Kansas City, Missouri area!

Text: Hotel was clean and well maintained, management is doing alot of updating that is apparent. Beds were comfortable with fitted bedding/sheets and room had microwave and fridge with cable television , desk & chair, bathroom remodeled with ok water pressure , a/c quiet and efficient .
Breakfast was continental but good, hot coffee and the outside smoking area had 2 tables, and  butt cans.
The hotel is multi-level but no elevator (older hotel bldg), limited additional parking in the rear, the check-in clerk was very pleasant and accommodating (rare).
The room had no place to hang clothes or put luggage up though.
Overall a very enjoyable stay and would definitely stay here again if in the area. ??

Text: The woman who runs this hotel is friendly and kind. She was a great help to me I was on the  road crossing the country and looking for a nice pet friendly hotel and it was just what we needed. The hotel was clean, quiet, and you could tell she is working to continually improve it. I would definitely stay here again.
