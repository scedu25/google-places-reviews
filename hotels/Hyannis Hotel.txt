Text: We do a lot of traveling through remote parts of the country and find ourselves in little towns.  We were so happy to have found the Hyannis Hotel.  Over 100 years old, great history, restaurant/bar/hotel in a little town?  That's awesome.  The staff was incredibly sweet and went out of their way for us.  AC in the room, only one channel on the TV (History Channel) - the only drawback is that there is no wifi.  Overall, we loved it and will definitely stay here again if we are traveling in this area.
