Text: Have stayed here many times and love it. Very laid back and always meet wonderful people. Read a couple neg. Reviews, well people this is a campground not a 5 star resort!! A great place to take your family!! Clean, the little cabins are nice. The pool is wonderful. There is lots of room for children to run and play. 
This is a terrific place for families to come together and spend quality time with each other, rather than taking a vacation spending time on the phone or Internet.

Text: My family has been camping at Eagle Valley Campground for more than 25 years. It's a beautiful and clean place and very family friendly. We have always been treated extremely well. Also, we really enjoy coming during the 4th of July the owner has an awesome firework show and music. Great pool, paddle boats, and fishing.
