Text: Only came for the laundromat, but it's pretty nice! Had the place to myself, free WiFi, comfy furniture, the whole nine yards. $2 per cycle in the standard-size washers and dryers, which is pretty cheap for a washer but a bit more expensive for the dryer compared to nearby towns. Still, five loads of laundry for $20 is a pretty solid bargain!
