Decker Hotel

Text: What a beautiful historic hotel. But what disastrous management. Beautiful Restaurant closed. No one at front desk. Just a phone number posted which wasn't answered.  I wandered the empty hotel for an hour before finding someone to check us out. Doors to lobby locked from 7 pm until 11 am the next day (fire code???). It is such a shame that this business is so neglected and mismanaged. Upon complaining about the lack of service and cutting our stay short, we were refunded our nights stay. Thank you for recognizing the problem.

Text: I paid for a package on the Decker Hotel website the lady at check-in was not aware that they offered the packages that they offered.  So I had to let her know that I paid for a package.  After we settled in we went back down and they apologized and fixed everything.  The hotel itself was very clean and the staff was very nice.  I was really hoping that the hotels restaurant was open,  but it must be under renovation.  I don't normally revisit hotels,  but I will be coming back here so I can get the full experience.
