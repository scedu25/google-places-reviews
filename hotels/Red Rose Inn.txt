Text: Wonderful B&B steps from downtown Bardstown. Small, quiet and extremely well maintained and managed by Audrey Simek who made two of the best breakfast's we've had anywhere. Very easy access to the best Bourbon Bars in area (and restaurants in Bardstown. The room we stayed in, the Hunt Room was spacious, comfortable, quiet and clean. We don't travel all that much but we prefer B&B's and this was one of the very best B&B experiences we've ever had.

Text: Had a most enjoyable evening. Cookies when we arrived. A lovely breakfast outdoors on the patio and great food. Wonderful pecan pie muffins with fresh fruit cup. Herbed potatoes and baked eggs in havatti cheese. Bacon and warm rolls. Coffee and 
orange juice. Yum. Gave good directions. Close enough to excellent restaurants that we strolled to dinner and back. Bed comfortable. Great experience.
