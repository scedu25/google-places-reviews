Text: Beautiful old building. My husband had the open faced ribeye sandwich, I had the Cobb Salad, and my young son had a grilled cheese and mashed potatoes. The food was amazing! Our service was friendly, fast, and very attentive. We can't wait to come back and try something new. Thank you!

Text: It was a wonderful experience spending a weekend at the Continental Hotel in Centerville. It was like stepping back into the good life of the good old days. A nicely restored building alive with a cheerful staff.
     What a great feeling to wake up from a good nights sleep on a comfortable bed followed by a refreshing soft water shower. Then a delicious breakfast served with a big smile.
      By coincidence the front of the hotel was surrounded by numerous vintage automobiles belonging the friendly members of a car club that also spent the weekend at the Continental Hotel.
     What a memorable weekend spent surrounded by memories of the good old days. The food was excellent and very well priced when paid with the complementary coupon. However, room rate seem a  little on the high side; but one gets what one pays for.

Text: They had cold brew cocktails. They charged us for them even though they were terrible and we didn’t drink them. Service was also slow and kept messing up our order. After I complained they decided to give us half the money back for the coffee drinks. She said we have to charge you something for them because it cost us that much to make them. It took everything within me not to roll my eyes. Our order was like $50, really? The vegetarian pasta was awful and bland. They don’t have much options and everything is way overpriced. They buy 12 dollar bottles of wine and sell them for 26 bucks. Oh, but you can’t refund me for horrible drinks? Honestly skip this place and go to the Garage where they are friendlier and wayyyy cheaper. I’ll NEVER be back.

Text: It's a historic hotel that has been upgraded recently with history in mind. The staff is always helpful and friendly. The food is always good. Staying here on business trips for the last 6 years, the continental has been getting better Every time we stop.
