Text: The room met our needs, though it could use some extra power ports for this technological age we are in. Would stay again.

Text: A very nice place to stay. Room were clean and well maintained. Breakfast area was small but was good enough for us. Small continental breakfast but was very filling. Just the right amount. Why have twice that amount of food. You can't eat it all anyway! Would definitely recommend this place.

Text: Was driving home to Indiana after attending grandson's graduation in Texas. Long drive and needed a place to stay. Super 8 was just off the highway and I decided to give them a try.
