Text: Wonderful place to stay.  Clean rooms and the area is beautiful.  Great breakfast!  Owners are very sweet and welcoming.  We will be back.  Our friends stayed in the home and we stayed in the cottage.  Best retreat around!

Text: My wife and I stay at lots of beds and breakfasts.  This is one that we classify as "advanced".  It doesn't have all the amenities of some other properties (though it does have the basics: AC and private baths) and, yes, there's a front end loader in the driveway.  But Richard and Elizabeth are wonderful hosts and the property is spotless, very much suited to our needs.  Breakfast was as good as we've had at any B&B.  I'd recommend JHM to anyone who likes the B&B experience.  Be sure to spend some time asking about the art in the house; Elizabeth painted most of it.

Text: The house is charming! Rooms are period furnished. Clean, comfortable beds. Each room has it's own bathroom.House has been beautifully restored. You will not want to leave the front porch! Richard and Elizabeth prepare a wonderful breakfast that will keep you going all day! Not to mention your evening snack. Price is right as well. No TV. Just relaxation!
