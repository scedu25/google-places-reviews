Text: Almost a century old, this definitely has the feeling of the old motor court hotels. The age is showing, quite a bit in some spots, but it was clean and that's what matters the most for my husband and myself. We don't need a heated pool, just a clean shower. The staff was great, checking us in after 10, getting more pillows and blankets, and were super polite. Each room has a theme, so if mounted wildlife bother you, ask for the railroad (where my husband wants to stay next time) or American flag room. They have bbq grills set up for the guests to use, and a coin washer and  dryer. We interacted with quite a few people in town and they were all complimentary of the owners and  staff of the motel.
