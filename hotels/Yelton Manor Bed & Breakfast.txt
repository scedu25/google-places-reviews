Yelton Manor Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: I visited Yelton Manor to enjoy a peaceful fall weekend on Lake Michigan and it was the perfect place to stay. Yelton Manor is right across the street from the lake and just a short walk into downtown South Haven. The Manor, Guest House and gardens are beautifully cared for and my room, the Lilly room, was a charming, sunny room with comfortable bedding and amenities.

This was my first time to stay in a B&B and it was delightful! The Hosts were gracious and helpful and I really appreciated the thoughtful and healthy breakfast offerings...and the brownies.....omg!

Text: My husband  and I stayed here for the first time.  The hospitality was above and beyond and Robert and Elaine made us feel at home. It was very private, quaint and clean. The afternoon snacks and breakfast was awesome!   We were in walking distance from the lake and the town. I would highly recommend!

Text: My husband and I enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was delicious, as well as the snacks in the afternoon and the homemade brownies were the best. Nice rooms, patio area, and steps away from lake Michigan. Beautiful!

Text: I visited Yelton Manor this summer. Very nice, well decorated b&b. The house was clean, in good repair, and near the beach and downtown. Excellent location.
