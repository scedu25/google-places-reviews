Text: Very nice hotel, looks and feels new, rooms are comfortable, clean, and up-to-date. Seconds from the highway and lots of food nearby. Will definitely stay again if I come back to town!

Text: Room was decent could use some updates. Staff was friendly and helpful. Pool area could be improved, and I really wish they would bring the hot tub back. All in all a good place to stay.

Text: Brand new ownership, and has only been running for a few weeks. Definitely has some room for improvement, but everything that could be better was clearing being worked on. Great management, and very friendly and accommodating day staff.
