Text: I stayed here back in 2015 but I forgot to write a review!  I had an awesome experience.  I wasn't expecting such an excellent experience from a 2-star rated hotel.

1. Friendly staff and the neighborhood felt safe!  I drove a nice car I didn't want broken into, never felt vibes as if my car were about to get stolen!

2. The breakfast in the morning was delicious!  It was literally an all you can eat breakfast.  Scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, and more!  Just delicious!

3. Comfortable mattress with clean sheets.  Wall mounted climate controlled A/C unit.  Large bathroom with rails to help the disabled, clean towels.

Text: I stayed here for a few nights. The room was immaculate! Entire staff was friendly! Complimentary warm breakfast was delicious: fruit, waffles, eggs, and coffee, to name a few, were provided.  I had an issue with the shower, but they immediately fixed it while I was downstairs enjoying my breakfast. Rooms are cleaned daily. House keeping staff and maintenance were extremely friendly and professional. Overall, no complaints. Will be staying there in the future.

Text: the beds are very comfortable for how cheap this hotel is. good location, good continental breakfast, and probably the best free hotel coffee you can find.
