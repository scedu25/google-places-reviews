Text: Our experience  was terrible.  The room stunk like the sewer  had backed up! They did not credit  us with our ARRP discount and the sheets would  not stay on the mattress. They were way too small.  This was a new place  with two floors and no elevator!! The breakfast  was a joke,  a bagel and some toast, a few eggs and no meat.  I would not recommend this to anyone. And the juice tasted like the room smelled.

Text: Reserved room for my photographer and his wife for our weddingin Winterset. Rates were reasonable and they said the room was very nice. Good option if you want to stay close instead of driving from Des Moines.
