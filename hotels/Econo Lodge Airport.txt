Text: Room wasn't great, but not the worst. Staff was definitely TERRIBLE! I booked using a travel website and got a good deal - when I checked in the woman was clearly upset at how little I was paying and was trying to figure out why. She did not want to give me the room for that price even though it had already been paid for. When I tried to check out there was NOBODY at the front desk. I waited for at least ten minutes while other people lined up behind me to do the same. Finally I found a maid in the hallway and gave her my key card, though she didn't speak english and had no idea what was going on.

Typical cheap hotel owners of a certain race I won't name.

Text: I checked in at 1 am. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. No bugs and no problems throughout the night. Checked out early without trouble. Decent motel at a reasonable price.

Text: A fair price for a humble place.  Really humble!  Distracted, almost surly reception at the front desk.  Good location but in serious need of an update.  Only real positive was the good, cheery attitude of the fellow behind the front desk as I was departing.

Text: At 54 bucks a night don't expect much. The room was clean, but the bathroom was tiny. The ceiling in the bathroom had been patched, but yet to be painted. The bed was tolerable, but I wouldn't want to spend more then a night there. Over all if you have been driving all day and just want a room for the night then this place will fit the bill. Other wise find another place to stay.
