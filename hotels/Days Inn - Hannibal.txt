Text: Stopped here for the night while traveling The Great River Road. Very nice motel. Appeared to have been recently updated. Staff was pleasant, beds were comfortable and it was quiet.

Text: We traveled through Canada, NY,  West Virginia This was the worst room we had. It smelled so horrible we checked out early. The town was pretty full and it was late or we would have found something elsewhere.

Text: Very surprising for the cost. Hotels these days under 100 $ are sliding down hill but the place is very pleasant. It doesn't look like much but the beds are nice, the room is very clean, good shower pressure and the staff is very decent. Will definitely stay again.

Text: Wyndham Reward members; This place does not honor "Early Check In" privileges for members. When you need to wake up by 11pm, and you can't get in until 3, makes a difference in my opinion.
