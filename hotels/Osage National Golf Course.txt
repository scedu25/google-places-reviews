Text: This course is a regular when I come to the lake.  Love it.  

Staff is fantastic and very helpful.   From the bag unloading to the cart person.  Very helpful and cheerful.  Great.

The course was in fantastic shape.  Be careful the practice green is way slower then the real greens!  The tee boxes were perfect and easy to get tees into (not always the case in mid July).  The fairways gave great lies and rolled well.  Sand traps were in good conditions and consistent.  Greens ran true and were quick but not excessive.  

The only thing I don't like is that I prefer the Links and River courses but apparently you can't play that combination.  They have some way of rotating courses that I don't get.  The Mountain course is named Mountain for a reason.
