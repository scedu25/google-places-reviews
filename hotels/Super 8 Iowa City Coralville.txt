Super 8 Iowa City/Coralville
Rating: 1
Text: The house keepers didn't even touch the shower.  There was foam and a dirty hand print, as well as hair all over the wall.  We received 2 lotions and no shampoos. And then picked up a rotten apple with breakfast.  I stay at a lot of super 8 hotels and I'm familiar they are cheap. But the price kept rising, we paid $80, and when I brought pictures of our shower down to the front desk they only apologized without offering anyway to fix it. Definitely shop around or drive to the next exit on this one. It was nearly renovated and or first impression was that it looked nice... looks cam be deceiving

Text: Loved the clean feel of the new laminate floors and the style of the art headboards. Much better stay than the night before in a different city. Room was more spacious and had more accommodating hours for the continental breakfast.

Text: They claim to be newly renovated. Just a new paint job is all. You can hear everything. Floor above squeaked anytime someone walked on it. Insulation in the walls must be missing because you can hear the people in the rooms next to you. I travel a lot for work and will not be staying here again.

Text: Loved the location because very close to the Hospital. Great rates for a Hospital stay. The staff was very nice especially Misty because she was very accommodating when I brought my husband here from the Hospital.

Text: That Super 8 in Coralvill was fine. The desk clerk at check-in (Misty) was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and beds comfortable. Breakfast was just okay, but the coffee was good.
