Homewood Suites by Hilton Cedar Rapids-North
Rating: 5
Text: Only saw one conference room, and the restrooms, but the staff were all pleasant, and everything was very clean. We needed a private area, which they were able to accommodate for 40 people. Overall, great experience.

Text: The hotel was very nice. However, they say they allow pets, but charge extra. I booked through a third party sight and when I arrived they said I had to pay a 75.00 pet fee. They lowered it to 25.00. My room was nonrefundable so I had to pay the fee. For that reason I will not stay again.

Text: Friendly person checked us in, building and rooms are clean. Breakfast and M-TH evening snacks were very convenient for a large traveling family. The staff Darrel at the front desk, Tom breakfast and Jackie in Housekeeping were very customer focused! Note: We have learned that the pullout couches in any Hilton brand hotel we have stayed has the worst mattress it would almost be more comfortable on the floor because of the super thin mattress and bars to form the sleep space. My only complaint about this hotel chain that made me almost decide to give a 4 star is the dreadful pullout couches Hilton chooses.

Text: The service and the hotel itself was impeccable. We booked our room online, when we arrived we were told that the room type we reserved wasn't available. The manager upgraded us to the best available room. THAT is customer service!

Text: Great hotel. M-Th offer dinner meal free of charge. It's always different than the time before.
