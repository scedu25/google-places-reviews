Americas Best Value Inn & Suites Nevada
Rating: 5
Text: The Comfort Suite was priced under $100.00. In the past, small town motels with a jacuzzi simply had a single jacuzzi tub in a larger than normal room. This room has a small living room with tv, mini fridge, and microwave; a bedroom with a king bed and tv; jacuzzi tub room; and finally a full bath!! For a getaway for the hubby and I, it was amazing!!! Definitely renting this room again.

Text: Nice check-in.  Room was decent and acceptably quiet.  The sheets was clean but the bed appeared uneven. Bathroom acceptable.  An uninvited bug about scared me but will not walk again.
