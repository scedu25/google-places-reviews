Viking Hotel Story City

Text: Didn't have great expectations going into my stay, just based on other reviews. Anyways just like the other reviews state this hotel/rooms need there fair share of work. New carpet, walls were dingy and needed to be redone, bathroom door had a small hole in it that was taped up using brown tape, bathroom tiles needed an update. The bed and sheets were fine TV was also good. So overall I didn't think it was as bad as other reviewers stated. I am not picky and just cared mostly about having a bed and TV and so those two things were actually acceptable. Staff was also very friendly and it sounds like the owner understands that the rooms need there fair share of work and is doing the best he can.

Text: I cant think of a single complaint. The man manager is easy to talk to and the room are well sized. Pleasantly surprised with how well kept the place is.

Text: Didn't expect much for the price, but it was even worse than we'd anticipated. Dirty tub and walls, dilapidated mattress, holes in the towels and sheets. The location was convenient but it needs some serious TLC.
