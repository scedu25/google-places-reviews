Text: Read the reviews, and I don't mean the only good review from a fake account. Rock hard beds, A.C. takes 4+ hours to cool the room below 80* started at 87* stained sheets and pillow cases, bugs everywhere. I feel sorry for the owner/operator he seemed like a nice guy but the place isn't worth staying in. More exhausted from staying here than not sleeping. Had to call it an early day and get another room to rest. Save yourself the trouble.

Text: TERRIBLE! So terrible I didn't even stay the night!  I walked in to the front office and asked to see a room. The guy at the front desk was rude and kept looking me up and down. He asked where I'm coming from and was baffled as to why I wanted to see a room. It's common sense that one would like to make sure the bed they will be sleeping in is comfortable.  He proceeded to tell me that he will charge me  $80 to see the room.  I travel quite a bit for work and have never encountered anyone who acts like this towards a potential customer at a hotel/motel. He told me that the beds are new. I don't doubt that is true but from my experience I have been to hotels before  where I took the person at the front desk's word for it when they said the beds are comfortable. Coincidentally they also had new beds.  After unloading my stuff to get into the room I then ascertained that their new beds felt just sleeping on a sidewalk.  Ever since that experience I always ask to see the room first. This guy blatantly told me to take my business elsewhere.  Im appalled that someone in that line of business would treat a potential customer as such.  If I could write this negative stars I would. This is a good enough reason for me to tell anybody who reads this not to bother even going there!

Text: Too controlling. It's 100 degrees outside and they turn your AC up, making the room hot. So when you return to the room after a long hot day, you have to wait several hours for relief.
