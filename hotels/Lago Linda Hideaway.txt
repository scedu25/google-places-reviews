Lago Linda Hideaway
Rating: 4
Text: Very reasonable rates.  Clean and quiet.  Linda does a good job running her place.  Cabins for rent plus rv spaces.  Popular with rock climbers who want to get away from crowds at Miguel's

Text: Pretty laid back campground. When we went, we didn't see Linda or any other campground staff. I was frustrated that there wasn't any firewood for sale but the guy in the campsite next to us said that the firewood is for sale in a shed further down the road.  We chose our campsite, wrote it down on an envelope and stuck our money into the Honor Box. The bathrooms and showers are clean and well-maintained. It's about a 20 minute drive from most Red River Gorge attractions. Each campsite has a fire pit, picnic table, trash can and water spout. I liked how chill the campground was and the rich history of it.

Text: This is by far the best place I've ever camped. They built a great self sustaining resort that has all the essentials you need for an unbeatable cost!

Text: I've fallen in love with Lago Lindas. After years of camping at Miguels,  we decided to check out Lagos. It's clean, quiet, and beautiful. Not very structured - You've gotta be a little more self sufficient to enjoy Lagos. But I like that. Linda has been sweet and helpful every time we needed anything. I would definitely recommend this campground to all friends and climbers. Its our new go-to.
