Super 8 Springfield North I-44
Rating: 1
Text: Arrived and found double reservations were on file. Clerk was rude and refused to remove the charge from my credit card because I did not want the room. I reserved a first floor unit. I called the local police department to help resolve the issue. I called my credit card company to file a dispute. The experience only fortifies my resolve to avoid all Super 8 Motels. This is the worst managed motel ever!  Credit the Springfield Police department for arriving on scene within 5 minutes.

Text: Was really good. Comfortable beds.  Very nice staff. Great air conditioning, which is great in the summer. Was able to get a room, was late when we checked in . Fridge and microwave in room.  Would recommend to my friends and family traveling thru Springfield, Missouri.

Text: Over priced. Not for handicap. Must use small flight of stairs for upper and lower level. Blood stains on foot of bed spread. A/C sounds like engine turbine.
