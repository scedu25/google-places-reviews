Text: Very clean. Nice amenities. Beds are pretty soft, but I prefer them that way. Courteous staff. The hotel offers a bereavement rate. Noon check-out. Easily accessible from the highway. I would definitely stay here again!

Text: Convenient for accessing Katy Trail by bicycle. Undergoing renovations so bar is closed. Room is adequate for the price. Bed is comfortable. Breakfast is lacking. No protein option.

Text: Rooms was outdated. They had multiple items plugged into a power strip that was a fire hazard. The morning breakfast consisted of breads, cereals and a waffle maker...not impressed at all.

Text: Updated interior, comfortable beds and close to everything. Arris Bistro if you show ypur room card you get 15% off bill and it's within walking distance. Do get breakfast here with your stay.

Text: Comfortable bed, simple but adequate amenities, nice staff...

Those are the pros. 

The cons: 
Terrible selection for breakfast, I didn't expect anything spectacular but truly a pick of scraps. 

All of this would be fine if the hotel was reasonably priced. I paid very close to 100 dollars for a hotel I could've and have gotten for more around 65 dollars. It's not that I don't recommend the place. I will say though, find a cheaper hotel. It will be the same service but save you some money.
