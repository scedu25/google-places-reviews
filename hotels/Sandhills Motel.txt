Sandhills Motel

Text: Went tanking. Was really fun, scenic river. No clear instructions as to what to do at the end of the trip. Do we put everything away ourselves? Do we leave it for the staff? Overall recommended experience.

Text: It had been a hard day of riding after leaving Sturgis, SD.  It was dark and we werent' expecting to find a hotel for at least another 25 miles.  We came upon this place by accident when we saw a large group of people bbqing.    It could have been a roach motel at this point we were so tired we didn't care.  However we were pleasantly surprised.   The cabin was spacious and very clean.  The cabin was comfortable.  The air conditioner was loud but that was ok under the circumstances. Wasn't able to connect to the internet until the next morning when we were leaving.  That some times happens everywhere.  Turned out the group was tanking the next day.  They were very friendly, some of us hung out with them.  The rest of us knew about them going in so we didn't care about the noise.  With the door closed and the air conditioner on we couldn't hear them anyway.  The tankers introduced us to the bar and cafe that is catty corner from the motel, VERY FRIENDLY people, drinks were too generous, breakfast was good!  We will be back!
