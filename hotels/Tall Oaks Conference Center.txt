Text: I love taking groups of Girl Scouts to Tall Oaks for their horsemanship programs. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the horses are wonderful, the location is convenient, and the price is very reasonable.

Text: Nice enough place. I'm not religious so all the crosses and church services are annoying, but not too bad. The AC could use an upgrade. Given the cost of this place I'm sure they can afford better.
