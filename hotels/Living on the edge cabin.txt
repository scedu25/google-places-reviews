Living on the edge cabin
Rating: 5
Text: Living on the Edge is a great cabin.The location and the view are excellent! The cabin is big and well equipped. The Jacuzzi, billiards and the poker table work great. There are some minor disadvantages that can be easily fixed and this is why I give it 5 and not 4 stars. Most mattresses are very much uncomfortable. The carpet on the bottom floor was not vacuumed thoroughly. Not enough light on the porch to enjoy the the evenings after the kids are sleeping (we traveled with toddlers). Finally, you'll need to wait 10-15 minutes between using the same bathroom again because this how long it takes for the water to refill. However, the overall experience was very pleasant and I would highly recommend this cabin.
