Text: Looks nothing like website. Gravel roads, tight turns. Overnite stay so don't care about amenities. First campground ever traveling across US that couldn't more than three channels with antennae. If it was longer than overnight this would not be for us. People were nice. Stayed in Carthage last night in real RV camp ground for less, paved roads, large sites, cable hookups and great wifi.

Text: Great pull through. A little tight when slide outs are side by side
