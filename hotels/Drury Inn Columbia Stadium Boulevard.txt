Text: This was such a nice place -- clean, modern, bright, friendly.  And a great price.  There is a happy hour (which we missed).  The breakfast was great.  They even use real flatware and china -- what a change of pace from the competition.  Convenient location.  If we're ever in this area again, I will definitely book here.

Text: Well our room was right next to the fitness center on one side and the pool was just outside. We had a door that actually opened right into the pool center. Luckily the pool closed at 10 pm so the 20 teens that were screaming had to leave. The fitness center was open all night so we got to listen to random people work out late at night and early in the am. Breakfast was good. Beds were comfy. Room was clean. As far as drury inns this one didn't meet my expectations (especially for 180.00)

Text: Recently remodeled and looks great. The rooms are clean and much more fresh. Breakfast was good. The staff is friendly and helpful. The only downside is there is only one elevator and it is not near the main entrance.
