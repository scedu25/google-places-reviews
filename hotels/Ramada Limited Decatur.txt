Text: I reserved my room through the Wyndham app. The lobby was lovely, and the business center and swimming pool were conveniently located. There is no hot tub in the pool area. My "non-smoking" room reeked of stale cigarettes, including the bedding. It made me wonder if the sheets were even clean. I ended up sleeping with the window open. There was an ashtray in the room.
