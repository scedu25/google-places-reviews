Text: As soon as you walk in you smell smoke and realize its not what you thought based on pictures from the net. Manager was somewhat nice but his "new" card machine wouldn't work. The room was clean-ish. About as well as a teenager would clean. Mattress was springs that you could feel individualy. Most things in the room were unplugged or strangely wired to random switches. Example 3 switches in the bathroom, one light and fan that came on with one switch.
