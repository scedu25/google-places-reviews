Crazy Horse Campground, L.L.C.
Rating: 4
Text: We just moved to Illinois about 6 years ago and happened to be lucky enough to find Crazy Horse! We simply LOVE this campground! The small cabins are great for last minute camping plans especially if you don't own a tent or are not sure if the weather will cooperate during your stay. They always have neat activities for the kids on the weekends to keep them busy. The nightlife is action packed when they have bands on weekend nights... Yet it is a nice quiet campground that is perfect for families. The swimming pond is warm and clear with a sand beach and volleyball court. Also fishing is a must! So many activities I can't mention them all! The price is affordable. It's clean! The owners are super friendly. We spend summer days there during the week just hanging out in the sun! Our families favorite place in the area!

Text: This is a little late, but, we went there this summer for the first time, and let me tell you. It was amazing. The staff are wonderful, such a great family environment. If your looking for a quiet place to camp, with great views, friendly and accommodating staff, look no further. We spent a week here, and will be returning every summer. Can't wait to see you all!
