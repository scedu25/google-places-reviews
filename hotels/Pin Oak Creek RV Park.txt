Text: Day Two:

Spent the night at Pin Oak Creek in W. Virginia.  Nice little place with great rates.  Thirty bucks a night. Overnight air temp was 50 degrees.  Used heater in the RV for the first time.  Works great.  Only five hours away from Virginia Beach!

Text: Nice place, clean facilities, quiet except for the nearby interstate. It was also reasonably priced as well. I didn't like the 12 pm checkout though.

Text: Very loud, fog horn for events going off late at night.  Air is dense with smoke; poor area air flow.
