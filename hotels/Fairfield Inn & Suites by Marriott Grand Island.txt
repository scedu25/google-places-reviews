Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Grand Island

Text: We came to enjoy an evening with my husband that is working her in Grand Island. They do not allow beverages of any sort in the pool area. Security came in multiple times to reinforce the policy. They sit at the front desk watching the cameras and come immediately in to make you toss it. Staying late this morning so my kids can swim. Sitting enjoying watching them swim and drink a coffee while I read the paper and in comes the security guard to make me throw it out. I understand not being allowed glass bottles but the one area of the hotel we came to kick back and relax at we were not able to. We will NEVER stay here again! SO DISAPPOINTING!

Text: We stayed here last month during the Junk Jaunt for two nights.  We had to pay 20.00 per night extra to use debit card, with the understanding it would be credited back to us. We have called twice to see why they haven't given us the refund...a month later...and they tell us it's the banks fault!!  Won't be staying there again.?

The issue has been resolved?

Text: The people who work here are very professional and thorough. The rooms were clean and put together nicely as well. Not a wrinkle on the sheets. Big tv, adequate lighting, clean bathrooms. So white i was almost scared to touch anything.

Text: Check-in was disconcerting. I'm a Marriott Silver Elite and have never received a lecture like this at check-in. No tailgaiting. Quiet hours from 11pm to 7am. And so on. Then asked to sign a form acknowledging I understood. Of course. That didn't stop the 400 pound gorrilla in the room above us from doing jumping jacks at 530am, but Hey, what can you do. Paper thin walls. Zero parking. Beds we're fine. Location close to food.
