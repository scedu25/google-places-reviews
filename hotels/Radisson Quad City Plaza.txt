Radisson Quad City Plaza

Text: Hotel was clean and very conveniently located. Very cool open layout inside. Room was nice, clean, no bedbugs. Great view of the river from my room. Only complaint was that the elevators were slow, I ended up just using the stairs most of the time.

Text: The bed awesome, they left a personalized letter in my room to greet me and it's a nice and spacious room. I will say they need more staff. Especially to check people in. I was also here for a professional event and I found it a good venue for the presentation.

Text: Nice enough hotel. Prices were reasonable. The front desk staff was hit and miss: the lady that checked me out was wonderful but the man that checked me in was very rude.

Text: I stayed at the Radisson for a work conference at the River Center. The Center is just down the block from the hotel, and there is even a skyway making travel too and from ridiculously simple. The quality of the rooms was also high and I received a complimentary breakfast buffet. I would definitely stay here again.
