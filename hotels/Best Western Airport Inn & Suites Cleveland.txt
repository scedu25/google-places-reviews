Text: Brought my daughter here with 5 friends for a birthday pool party! 
I can't say anything more than we all had a BLAST! We had some trouble with our key card getting into the pool, but both times the manager came to rescue in seconds! The kids loved every minute of the pool. Thank you Best Western, for providing a nice establishment that's affordable, CLEAN, and comfortable!

Text: The staff was wonderful and friendly. The rooms were very clean. The surrounding business were affordable.  There was even a park within walking distance for the kids to run a bit. Definitely will return in the upcoming months when we visit our son at Baldwin Wallace University which was only a 10 minute drive.

Text: Check in was very confusing.  We had requested a King Bed room with an even number and was given a key to a room with 2 doubles on the opposite side of the hotel.  The staff seems to have changed and they were not very familiar with things.  It took us longer than normal to check-in and then was told we could not receive the room requested. "Don't worry we will take care of you", is what we were told and that they would give us a nicer/upgraded room. The staff went up to check to see if another room was ready for us.  Gave us our keys to what we were told was an "upgraded" room and it turned out to be just one with 2 double beds.  Not my idea of upgraded.We are Reward customers stayed here multiple times just this year and several times last year.  I also think the breakfast items have been scaled back.
