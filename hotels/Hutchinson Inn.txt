Text: No frills lodging minutes from the fairgrounds. Room was clean, the front desk staff were friendly, and the shower was hot. Can't ask for more than that at this price. Would stay here again.

Text: Served our needs. Car broke down while travelling cross the country. Small breakfast but it's something, spanglers not to far away (about 1.5mile). Train near by, didn't bother me but I'd say it goes by 2x a day. Friendly staff, bed to sleep on and a hot shower- We'll be staying again!
