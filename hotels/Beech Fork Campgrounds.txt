Text: Really nice campground, very clean & tidy. Would be nicer if the dead trees were removed in Old Orchard campsites. Quiet campers. Lots of kids, dogs, bikes, scooters.

Text: Great place to ride bikes, hike, and kayak. Beautiful scenery. We stayed in cabin number 5. We had a great time. It was nice, but it wasn't 5 star worthy.  The cabin definitely could have been cleaner and the beds were uncomfortable. Also, no fires are allowed at the cabin. Super bummer. 

We also tent camped one night. It's a pricey lot and you're only allowed to have one tent (unless it's a small one for your kids). That's ridiculous. 

However, I would go back and I would suggest it. Just don't expect a 5 star experience. And perhaps go in November for cheaper cabin prices.
