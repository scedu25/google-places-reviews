Text: If they ever call you and say you won 14 nights of free camping....its a scam.

I recieved this very phone call about two weeks ago after filling out a form at the fair. The lady says that me and the wife have to come up and "claim" the prize in person. I thought, ok this makes sense. So we went, get there and the guy starts talking about memberships, etc. I made it very clear we were not purchasing anything. He said thats fine as long as we sat thru the presentation/tour we'd get the free camping, so i said ok. We sat thru a short little video then we went in the other room where he began fast talking and trying to get us to sign membership papers, We got up and walked out. Dont waste your time.

Text: This is the Cleanest, safest park I have ever been in. It is safe for your children to play and do activities. The pool area and showers are clean and the staff does a great job of creating a friendly and fun place to be. The park has great activities for the family and kids.
