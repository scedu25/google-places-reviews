Text: Not the worst place we have ever stayed at but not the best either.  Comforter looked stained but the sheets were clean.  Breakfast was mediocre at best.  No fresh fruit.  Either have eggs OR french toast sticks.  No meat.  Staff is friendly though. You get the basics here. No frills.

Text: No star in my opinion! Woke up to bed bugs crawling on the sheet and I had welts all over. I felt disgusting and I went to the front desk to ask for a refund. Promised full amount but never got it back. Manager is always gone and my wife has to fight for her money back. I am not pleased from the service at all. The owner argued very heavily with me saying they don't have bed bugs but I have pictures proving they do. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone!

Text: It had nice bed. Hallway  smelled like cigarette smoke. WiFi was spotty. But if you just need a bed good spot.

Text: My husband and I recently made it only a few hours in one their rooms. Woke up to my husband having welts from being bitten. Went immediately to the front desk where we where promised our money back and apologies. Not only did we not receive our money back they withdrew extra. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. As my husband and myself have called numerous times, the manager seems to never be available. Only reason for a single star is to save someone else from being attacked by bed bugs and lies.

Text: Hotel was easy to find but awkward to get to- roads are a little wonky. Room was clean and quiet. Breakfast was adequate.
