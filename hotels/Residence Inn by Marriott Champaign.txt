Text: Comfortable, quiet and large rooms. Very good breakfast. Pay attention when you walk into the room, on your left is an orange light switch. If that is off there is no power or lights in the entire room, we found out the hard way and had to ask. Carpets were being cleaned when we arrived, and the entire place was very clean. Very nice pool area!

Text: We stayed here for months after a house fire and it became our temporary home! The staff was friendly and we genuinely had a good time considering the circumstances. Plus the mixers on weeknights are fantastic!
