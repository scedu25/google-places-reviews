Hampton Inn & Suites Springboro

Text: The rooms were ok but could use a better cleaning. (Some others in our party had a horrible experience with there room and needed to talk to the front desk to resolve the issue.) Staff was friendly. The pool area was nice but small just like the workout areas. The breakfast selection was good but not very well stocked.(eggs gone, then no coffee, then no bagels, etc etc.) Stay if you get a deal but don't go out of your way to stay here.

Text: Recently renovated, which is nice, but toilet in 313 is loose and new sinks designed poorly, faucet barely covers sink and no towel racks. Other than that looks nice.

Text: This hotel is under renovation. The room I stayed in was better than most. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I've ever experienced. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

Text: DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I wish I could post pictures of the filth and disgust this hotel considers acceptable. Paint stripped from walls, coke machine in the middle of the hallway, no towels, no trash can, tools laying in the hallway, paint buckets sitting in hallway. Paint smell causes instant headaches within the building. They are in the middle of a remodel and have no problem putting customers in unfinished rooms. Ashley at the front desk refused to get a manager when I complained. Hilton has serious issues with this property.

Text: The room was spacious and clean. The staff was very accommodating and helped us find things to do in the area. There is a nice lobby with a great complimentary breakfast! I was very happy staying here.
