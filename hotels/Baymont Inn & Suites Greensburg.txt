Baymont Inn & Suites Greensburg
Rating: 2
Text: It used to be a good place to stay for the night. Seems to have gone down hill. I stayed on the second floor there is no elevator. Air conditioner did not seem to work. I had it on high and I was still warm all night. The shower had good pressure on the water was hot, though. They were something under the sheet that was itchy in bed

Text: Stayed here for vacation while visiting family. They offer Free breakfast each morning, an indoor heated pool, a small work pot room is also on site. They have nice spacious hotel rooms that are affordable. The employees are the best!! They were very friendly,  accommodating and made our stay a pleasurable one. We will definitely stay here again when in town.

Text: Great location to I-74. I think it's reasonably price, lady at the front desk was friendly. But just like any other Hotel there's always something positive and negative about it but overall I give it a 4 out of 5

Text: I  will not stay at Baymont Inn til they hire someone like Victoria instead of that rude snotty general manager Heather. I was about to lose my composure. Hateful, rude.
