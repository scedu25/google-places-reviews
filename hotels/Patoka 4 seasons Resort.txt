Patoka 4 seasons Resort
Rating: 3
Text: Cabin #4 was very clean and adequate for our weekend boating getaway to Lake Patoka, which was awesome. The mattresses on the beds could've been better. Ample parking at the cabin included our SUV, boat and trailer too! Proximity to the boat launching ramps was just a few minutes. We'll be back.

Text: Amazing cabin. Nice and clean, you will find some bugs (it's a cabin in the woods). Hot tub seemed very clean too. Very polite and friendly staff. A+

Text: Cleanest hot tub I've rented. Cabin was very dated and not cleaned well. Unless you really want the hot tub and plan on cooking your own meals instead of dining out, get a nearby hotel room or camp. I didn't feel like cabin was a good value overall. Staff was friendly, and the on site pool very clean. Spiders and ticks inside cabins - welcome to an authentic cabin in the woods!
