Best Western Fostoria Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: The only decent place to stay in Fostoria.  The rooms were clean and the staff was very helpful.  Nice variety of food for breakfast. I've stayed at places that have continental breakfast which only consisted of cereal and donuts.  Best Western offered sausage, scrambled eggs and make your 
own waffles.   Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Fostoria.

Text: Room was clean and decorated nicely. Bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was good. Biscuits and gravy and fold over omelette were the hot foods. Price was a little high but competitive with the area.
