Text: VERY nice campground.  We only stayed one night and they gave us a fantastic site.  Very clean facilities and extremely well kept grounds.  If we lived closer we would love to have a permanent site here.   Do yourself a favor and stay here whenever you can.

Text: This is a very nice campground, clean facilities, fun activities for everyone, friendly people and owners. They take pride in this place always seem to be doing something to make it better. I enjoy this place very much but there are 2 things that do bother me somewhat. #1 the lack of weekend sites for friends or family to camp with you for the weekend although they can camp on ur seasonal lot if ur lot is large enough for 2 campers and you don't mind paying their electric bill. #2 the amount it cost visitors to come in and sit on ur lot that you paid good money for to rent for the season. Most people that visit us might stay for an hour or so and never leave our camper. 7 dollars per person is abit much just for that. I would really like to see them charge more if my visitor chooses to fish or swim then I understand  they are using their  facility. Some places do wristbands or stamps for such situations and if they get caught without it they get booted. Don't miss understand this is a great place and great people but these  2 issues do bother me somewhat.
