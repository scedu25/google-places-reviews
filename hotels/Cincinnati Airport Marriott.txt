Cincinnati Airport Marriott

Text: Beautiful lobby and excellent gym. Clearly recently redecorated, very modern feel. Rooms are also modern, but dirty. Staff was pleasant but with the exception of Devan mostly inefficient. Pool can't be attended alone, making it difficult for a single traveler to get in laps. Can't beat the close proximity to the airport though!

Text: The atmosphere was happy everything was pretty and pristine and the employees are great. My room was beautiful. My only problem was that the bed is very high and I'm 5 foot 4 and it came about to my waist. After just having surgery I found it very hard to get in the bed and out of the bed and spent an almost sleepless night ... about 2 hours sleeping on the couch. So no note to short people who are less than agile  bring your step stool!

Text: Friendly staff, unlike any other hotel I've been to. Very eager to go above and beyond for a simple question. Amenities are average. Down pillows in summer? Frosted glass sliding bathroom door? You can see through it, and it doesn't close properly, so you can see in and out through the gaping sides....
