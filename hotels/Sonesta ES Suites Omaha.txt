Text: If you get room 624, don't use the upstairs shower.  It has VERY little hot water pressure.  The sink is fine.  Makes no sense to me.  Outside of that, great location, great price for what you get, and descent shopping and dining in the area.

Text: The hotel is decorated nicely and the set up is very nice. My only complaint would be the carpet is so dirty that it turned my socks brown! Otherwise the rest of the room is very clean. The accommodations are great and they are in a very good location. Will be staying here again.

Text: My family and I are staying for the weekend to visit the Omaha zoo. We were a little nervous when we first arrived, because it didn't look that great on the outside. However, the rooms are spacious and pretty nice for the price. The room wasn't quite as clean as I'd like, but nothing major. I brought it to the managers attention and she discounted my room. Overall, for the price I think it is worth staying. The rooms are more like apartments which makes me a little nervous being open to the outside, but we haven't had any issues.

Text: It was absolutely amazing!!! They upgraded us to a larger room free of charge and without us even asking them too!! All of the employees were extremely helpful, the room was absolutely gorgeous, pool and grounds were clean. I highly recommend this place! We will definitely be back!
