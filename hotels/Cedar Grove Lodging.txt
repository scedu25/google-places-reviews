Cedar Grove Lodging

Text: My wife and I went down for a 3 day weekend.  The cabin was great! Clean, private, and had all the necessities. It's located very close all the places to go hiking, restaurants, and the spa is just down the road as well. The hot tub was clean and refreshing with the mild weather. Back porch and front porch were awesome as well.  I have nothing but great things to say about our experience and time at the cabin! They even returned my binoculars that slide under the dresser!! I would highly recommend

Text: The cabins are near each other, but not too close so you still have privacy. The driveway is paved and easy to drive on in the winter. The cabins are new and clean. The owners seem interested in you having a good visit. Highly recommended.
