Land of the Arches Campground

Text: Perfect spot for our two-week climbing trip. The free hot showers were the main selling point in making the decision to camp here and we were not disappointed. The (huge) community area, complete with table tennis tables, was a great escape from the elements on rainy days. The owners were very friendly and helpful. Thanks for a great time :)

Text: The campground itself was pretty good.  Cheaper rates, the communal cooking area and indoor rec areas were great for those days we got rained out!  Most of the people we met were great as well.  The only problem for us was when they had a concert scheduled. The quiet hours start at 11, by the time 2 am rolled around and we still had 20 some campers partying around our tent we weren't happy.  When we asked them to call it a night and quiet down we were basically told to move our tent.    The owners didn't enforce the quiet hours until about three am after receiving calls from several of us campers.  The next day when we asked about it they told us that they let the noise and concert go longer.

Text: My favorite campground in Red River Gorge! Excellent facilities and kind staff. Offers more personal space and closer access to vehicles than other nearby campgrounds.

Text: Ok campground but you have to walk up and down hills to get anywhere, including for water
