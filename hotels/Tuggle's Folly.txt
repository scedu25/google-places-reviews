Text: Stayed at Tuggles' Folly to visit area museums.  Hosts, Dean and Debbie are a friendly couple who work hard to make guests feel at home.   Their dog and cats were also friendly.  Room was nice and well-kept.  Beautiful Ohio river view from house.  A nice place to stay.

Text:    Excellent experience overall. The accommodations were last minute and very
amenable. Everything was clean and convenient. The hospitality second to none.
   I was made to feel at home and provided with a family atmosphere. The breakfast was exceedingly good and left me with a very good start for a possibly busy day.
   Thank you.
