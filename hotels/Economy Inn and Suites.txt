Economy Inn and Suites

Text: Was in ground level smoking room. For the price it was what I expected. Not terribly clean but not disgusting either. No bugs/rodents besides a solitary fly. Front desk is understanding when you lock yourself out several times. They have a basic Continental breakfast. The pool seems to be popular, though I didn't use it.

Text: The place really needs an update. It smelled like smoke and like someone had a pet there previously. I also woke up with a bite on my side. I didn't want to take a shower there. I probably will pay $20-30 more to stay somewhere better next time

Text: Filthy. Toilet clogged. Insects and debris abounded. Front desk staff did OK. Simple help-yourself breakfast OK (check out the bizarre mezzanine!). Can't beat the price. I lodged therebecause it was absolutely the only late availability for the eclipse.

TO THE OWNER(S):
Tour your investment before the state or municipal authorities close your place.

Text: Supposedly remodeled room was filthy with crust on the walls, torn sheets a destroyed lamp and wires hanging out of the wall, the fridge was Rusty and evertime the AC turned on my allergies went ballistic. I found used water bottles everywhere and the tub water was reversed so when I was turning it hot it was only giving cold. The front clerk said she'd let management know but how could they not have done a walk through after the work was done?
