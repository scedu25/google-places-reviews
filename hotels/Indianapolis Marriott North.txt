Text: Stayed over night with granddaughter after a trip to American girl doll store. Picked this hotel for rate and proximity to the store  Checked in early and they were very accommodating. Room was newly remodeled, clean. Bathroom was very nice. No free breakfast but we knew that going in. Pool area was very clean and our granddaughter loved it. Overall great experience would definitely stay again.

Text: Here for a lacrosse tournament  and our stay was nice. The room was clean, modern, and had a tranquil water view. The people were nice, helpful, and friendly. The breakfast buffet/omelet bar was good. If we are staying in the area we will be doing so back at this hotel.

Text: Nice hotel, very friendly staff. Our only problem was with some badly behaving kids at the indoor pool. About 20 kids in the pool with no adult supervision, throwing balls everywhere, hitting people, and being very loud. Made it miserable for our two younger kids. Hotel staff needs to do a better job of keeping an eye on the pool area and actually enforcing the rules.
