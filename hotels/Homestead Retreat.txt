Text: Have been to the Homestead many times.  It's a quiet get a way.  If you love the country then this is the place.  Lots of woods to explore and enjoyed seeing the cows. The house is country quaint with plenty of space.  The kitchen has everything you need for big family dinners. We always eat in.  Shirley was gracious and very knowledgeable of things to see and do in the area, although there is plenty to do in Grafton.  Shopping, wineries, boating, etc.
