Text: It's a no perks motel. The free breakfast is kinda a joke but it bed is comfortable and house keeping does clean rooms daily and I always have a good supply of towels etc.

Text: The room we were given had meth bags and meth all over the floor. There was hair every where. Even after they cleaned it was still dirty. Do not stay here.

Text: Love this hotel. We stayed for my birthday.  We stayed 5 days . Great breakfast!! Microwave,tv,free wifi,blpw dryer,and comfortable beds. The pool is outside and i never saw people cleaning it. Theyre were bugs in pool but thats understandable since its outside. Very nice people at desk?
