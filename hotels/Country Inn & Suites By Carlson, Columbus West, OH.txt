Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Columbus West, OH

Text: We had a nice night at this hotel although it is hidden behind the best western and so appears to be apart of the best western. The bed was a little hard for my taste but overall the room atmosphere and noise level was great. Had a very nice person check is in. The breakfast had nothing hot except for a western omelette and something else unappealing to me. They had cereal and breakfast breads and a waffle maker and juices. Which filled me up just fine.

Text: Stayed here overnight on way from DC to St Louis. Room was clean and bed was decent. Major temperature difference between bedroom and suite area where kids were sleeping. TV in the bedroom didn't work. Breakfast options were fine, but I've seen better at similar hotels. Front desk personnel were rarely actually at the front desk. Wasn't terrible, but I'd probably try a different hotel if I had to make the same trip again.

Text: We booked at this hotel on May 4 for a stay on June 8.  The sole purpose of the trip was for a conference being held at this hotel on June 8.  The conference was cancelled on May 30.  We called on May 31 to cancel our reservation.  The hotel refused stating we booked using a rate that was not refundable although the stay was for a cancelled conference at the hotel.  Pretty inflexible and not customer friendly.  I called the corporate office who called the manager of the hotel.  The manager refused the refund to the corporate office.  I'll cross another property and chain off my future travel plans.  @countryinns
