Courtyard by Marriott Evansville East
Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were very clean. Staff were friendly. The bed was so comfortable. I honestly don't sleep as good at home as I did on the mattress there, and we have a sleep number at home. However they didn't have a hair dryer, which is no big deal. I usually bring my own, I just happened to forget mine this time.

Text: Nice facility. As a regular business traveler I like the Marriott brands because of the consistent quality. My only complaint with this stay was the motion sensitive thermostat. I hate waking up in the middle of the night and needing to move around the room to get the air conditioner working again. Otherwise it was a good stay.

Text: Comfortable, modern room. Very nice facilities. New bathroom design has some head scratchers, but overall not bad at all. Excellent friendly service, especially given the Eclipse traffic. A little pricey for what it was (when I travel and stay at a Courtyard I pay a lot less), but we were paying event pricing with the eclipse.

Text: Best hotel experience ever! Staff went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable and that my needs were met.
One name stands out in particular... Sarah, the assistant general manager, is the best in the business! Thanks for everything : )
