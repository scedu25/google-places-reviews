A VICTORY INN AND SUITES ANN ARBOR
Rating: 1
Text: This is absolutely a dive, but if you need a cheap place to stay for a night, it works (sometimes). The rooms are sometimes clean, sometimes dirty beyond belief. The front desk staff seems to be prohibited by management from doing anything, like issuing a refund, making the management just about the worst I've ever seen anywhere. I watched another customer get yelled at by the general manager when they *asked nicely* for a refund because of a dirty room, along with accusations that the customer had "set them up" or some nonsense like that. At night there seems to be plenty of prostitutes and drug dealers in and out of the rooms. At least one of the night staff speaks English clearly, but I think he's the only one, and it really doesn't seem like he (or any other employee) is allowed to help customers when they have a problem. It is what it is.

Text: Absolutely disgusting and horrible customer service. There were bed bugs in the pullout and the main bed and when we spoke with the front desk staff about it they were belligerent and rude and unwilling to help us. We ended up leaving to stay somewhere else and when we called the Victory Inn they refused to give us a refund for the $380 we gave them. We have been going through a nightmare since to get this refund back from them.

Text: This place is horrible. Customer service is horrible. Our beds were made daily but the same pillow cases were on the pillows every time after they had already came to clean the room. I know this because the same stain was on the pillow case. We had to ask for new towels everyday. Trash was left in staircase for 3 days before someone got it. The whole hotel smells like smoke even though it's a "smoke free" hotel. It took us 30mins to check in. The whole hotel is false advertised. There is a spot for a pool but no pool. Id advise people to spend the extra money and stay somewhere else. If there were an option for no stars that's what I'd give this place.

Text: This hotel is so dirty and rundown. The room smelled of stale cigarettes even though there is supposed to be no smoking. The bathroom was dirty. The staff at this hotel are no better, they aren't necessarily rude they just don't care. If you are looking for a cheap room just got to motel 6 or red roof inn on south state street. Just to let you know also, this place has also been cited for non-compliance. The citation is displayed on the front door.
