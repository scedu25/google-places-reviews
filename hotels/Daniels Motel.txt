Text: So where to start with this motel.  It is th worst motel I have ever stayed at. It is gross and filthy. It smells horrible and I dont think the front desk guy is all there. I asked him for more rags to clean the room with because the first 6 rags and towels were black from cleaning the room so far at this point. And then I proceeded to apologize because I turned the towels black. And he told me Don't worry it happens all the time. Wyd. It makes me question who they hire to clean or even if they ever clean.  Even though its a cheap motel the least they could do is clean it so you don't feel dirty staying here. I won't recommend it to anyone. We had a sign on our night stand that stated press 0 for front desk. Well there wasn't even a phone to call front desk. The only good thing I can say is they have a tv with cable that actually works. That's about all.

Text: Classic 70's motel. I slept on top of the bed in my sleeping bag because I didn't trust that the sheets were clean. I also didn't trust the towels...
