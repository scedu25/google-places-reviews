Archway RV Park
Rating: 3
Text: I'm sure if you have a RV the place is fine but if your pitching a tent you may want to find another location. The space for tents is in the middle of this field and there are no trees for shade....nothing. No individual fire rings for each campsite only one large ring off to the side. They also don't have adequate bathrooms to accommodate even a small group. 3 bathrooms in all. It got 3 stars because it has a laundry and the staff appeared to be accommodating.

Text: Stopped for the night after a long day of travel.  Tiffany, who answered the phone on my way in was the kind of person you like hearing on the other end. Very welcoming, and then did everything she could to find me a nice spot when I got there.  Full hookup in a spacious camp site, and despite being close to the highway, it was a quiet night for much needed sleep.  Very nice park, and staff.

Text: I've been to a lot of RV sites and this is the most pleasant experiences I've ever had. Firstly, the staff are some of the most friendly human beings you'll ever meet. Ralph was so friendly and accommodating to our special requests. On top of the super friendly staff, the RV park itself is very nice and well kept. The bathrooms and showers were super clean and the facilities had everything we needed. They even leant me some dish soap because we forgot it at the previous campsite we were at. The showers don't cost anything, the laundry was affordable ($1.50 per load and $1 for the dryer), and they have very affordable rates. We will definitely stay here again next time we pass through Mt Vernon.

Text: This setup is perfect. Located just on the edge of Mount Vernon with easy access to restaurants. The facility is very neat and clean . The service is second to none.

Text: Roomy clean showers & bathroom.  Easy access to pull through sites which are roomy enough for most RVs...no need to unhook.   Owners have renovated the Welcome building with rustic wood paneling and furniture. The flowers around the property are beautiful and add a nice homey touch. There is a cute little pond out back.  Friendly owners. Late night check in instructions are kind of confusing.  Convenient location to highway, gas, and food. We would stay here again.
