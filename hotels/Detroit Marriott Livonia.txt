Text: I stayed 2 nights here at the marriott, and enjoyed it very much. The rooms were clean, and the staff was very accommodating. It was also very nice how they had a mall inside the hotel which helped my kids be able to get out but still stay near

Text: Pretty decent hotel. Better breakfast than many other Marriott's I've visited recently, though it will set you back $16 for it. Gym is also larger and has some decent equipment. Pool area is covered and quiet, but the hot tub jets don't work. Also, there is no laundry service here, so if you're staying for more than a few days this may be a problem. The room I was assigned smelled smoky, so I asked the front desk to move me to another room and they gladly did so (it's a non-smoking hotel, anyways). Just next door is a fairly large and busy bar, so grab a drink there and you have a one minute walk back to the hotel.

Text: Hotel is updated. The whirlpool jets we're not working but the pool atrium was nice and open. Very nice courtyard area where we saw a private wedding so it seems like a nice venue. Didn't try the restaurant but saw several diners there for dinner and breakfast and food looked good. Connects to shopping mall which is also a nice place to visit and has a very nice Bar Louie.

Text: The room we used was well lit, the climate was very comfortable and the breakfast provided was excellent. The coffee was hot, but not overdone, and the staff were quick to clear away empty cups, and refill out pitchers of ice water.
