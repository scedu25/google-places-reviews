Abigail's Grape Leaf Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We had such a lovely stay at Abigail's. We stayed in the Parlor Suite. We loved how it walked straight out to the street, though that can come with street noise. The room was a great size and the bathroom is also big. The breakfasts and dessert were so good! The Innkeepers were very pleasant and accommodating. Highly recommend.
