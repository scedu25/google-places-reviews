Wallashuck Campground Lake Red Rock
Rating: 5
Text: Very nice campground for a family outing. Each lot had its own electric hookup, every block has a building with restrooms and showers which are cleaned and kept up daily. Staff are super friendly and helpful.

I actually ended up there due to car troubles and stayed for almost a week while waiting on a local mechanic to fix it. Bought a fishing license and played around the lake for the most part of my stay. Enjoyed joking around with the staff whenever I seen them, along with asking a question here and there about the wildlife or area since I am from a different state and not familiar with the surroundings.

The kids enjoyed the hot air balloon racing the one night and a 10 mile walk on the bike trail just outside the perimeter near the office.

Even met a famous MLB player and his wife on one of the last days of my stay.
