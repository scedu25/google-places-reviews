Text: Beautiful location in the heart of the Kansas plains, and just a short walk to a nice, private beach at the Marion reservoir. The house is so neat and clean and the hosts are very kind and responsive. Breakfast is A+ too! I highly recommend this bed and breakfast!

Text: NorthShore GuestHouse is a hidden gem.  It's quiet, gorgeous, and just down the road from the Marion reservoir.  I've enjoyed all of my stays, and the hosts are the nicest people.
