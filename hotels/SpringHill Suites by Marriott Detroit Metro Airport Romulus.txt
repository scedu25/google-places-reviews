SpringHill Suites by Marriott Detroit Metro Airport Romulus

Text: The breakfast lacked variety and the housekeeping was horrible.  It is a nice room but we were there for a week and the room was only properly cleaned twice.  They never put towels in the room and we had to buy our own soap because they never left any.  

The staff at the front desk was very friendly and apologetic.  

The pool was warm but there were no towels near the pool or the exercise room.  You have to use the towels from your room and as I mentioned above the housekeepers never left any.  So you have to constantly request towels from the front desk.

Shower door in bathroom leaks so the floor is constantly wet after each shower.

Stay somewhere else!!!

Text: Very busy but helpful staff. Be patient, they do care but are spread a bit thin at times. The coffee was super hot and fresh. The hotel has some wear but generally comfortable.

Text: Marriott hotels are always nice but WOW! This place is nice! I love the updated interiors, room layouts etc. This hotel is in a whole other league compared to the other hotels around the DTW airport.

Text: Convenient to airport and highways,  Clean and comfortable.  It would be nice to not have the UBER and Lyft drivers not use the parking lot as a waiting area for the airport. or at least not utilize the parking spots closest to the hotels
