Text: Well stocked with pretty much  everything you need in the kitchen. Extremely clean. Pet friendly. 
The only things we had to bring were extra towels, food, essentials.
Amazingly private.
We visited again, a year later. The cabin had a makeover and is more lovely than before. We will be back every year.
This year I walked the trails quite a bit. The views were spectacular!

Text: Beautiful cabin we stayed in cabin 1 loved the atmosphere very private.  My daughter loved catching fish in the stocked fishing pond and the hot tub was great.  It was nice that we could bring our dog and it is close to caves and parks.  We were sad to leave but we would love to come back sometime.  Owners were very nice.  We had a wonderful vacation.

Text: We stayed in Cabin 3 and found it to be Charming. The hot tub is a nice addition. It's close to many of the hiking trails.
