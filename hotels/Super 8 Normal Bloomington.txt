Super 8 Normal Bloomington
Rating: 1
Text: Left over hair all in the bathrooms. Half an inch of dust all over the walls, top of tv, and the lamps. Smelled like a petting zoo on the rooms, smelled like nasty cigarettes throughout the entire place. Paid 150 for one night visiting my son on family weekend at ISU... it was the only place available last minute for the weekend. There is s reason why. All these other reviews are so nice and dishonest. I would also only recommend this place if you wanna get eaten by bed bugs.... Yes. Super 8 is disgusting and dirty as hell. Do not go here ever.

Text: Nice clean room, everything worked as it should. No funky smells, decent shower, quiet and close to the freeway....just what I wanted in a quick trip stop over. Oh....and the price is very fair too (-:

Text: The management is not helpful at all. I dropped jewelry down the sink and they told me there was nothing they could do about it. Luckily it was not super valuable jewelry, but I'm still upset about its loss.
I later had wrinkled clothes I wanted to get a little water on so I could unwrinkle it. The water bleached my clothes! My shirt is ruined.
On top of that, the bed is not comfortable. You get a sheet and a thin blanket, no comforter. The breakfast is literally just frozen food from a store. I'm completely unhappy and do not recommend anyone ever stay here. I certainly am never staying here again.

Text: I believe they gouged me because the hotel was almost completely booked. Called for prices a couple weeks later on the same day of the week and the price was 1/3rd of what I previously paid. The hotel wasn't good enough to warrant what they charged. Will never go back.

Text: We left our phone charger here and they claimed it wasn't found. Also the whole hotel reaks of cigarette smoke!
