Rating: 5
Text: The rooms were very modern and the drapes keep the light out well so sleeping in was a breeze. The bed is very comfortable! Didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked nice. Overall I would give the stay high rating.

Text: The front desk personnel were very helpful and had been there for me when I needed it. The room was clean and appealing to my taste. I found the bed clean and comfortable. The love seat was nice to have for sitting around. The refrigerator is small but useful and the microwave is downstairs by the front desk. I recommend staying here for business stays.

Text: Overall a good stay. Pleasant check in without issue. Nice gym equipment. Great dinner from the bistro. Unfortunately, however, my shower had almost no water pressure which was a bit disappointing, and the rooms were clearly not recently updated. Overall pleased and would stay again.

Text: Location was great, right next to an outback steakhouse. Rooms were okay, a bit small for VIP price. But the staff were amazing and very friendly. Overall a great place to stay when traveling.

Text: My sister had a room block here for her wedding. The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating to our every need. The rooms were very nice.
