Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Georgetown, KY
Rating: 5
Text: Country Inn & Suites is our favorite chain and this is one of the best we have ever stayed at. Very clean, good breakfast, and all of the staff were very friendly. Our room was large enough that we were able to bring in a rollaway bed and still be able to move around. We would stay here again.

Text: One the nicest and cleanest CI & S we've stayed at. The staff was a little grumpy but we got over that. We would definitely stay and recommend this location for CI & S.

Text: This hotel has a nice lobby. The fireplace really captures you when you walk in. You can tell however as you walk through that this property was renovated and attention to detail was lost throughout. For example the push door handle on the bathroom door in our room was installed backwards, and pushing downward to open the door did not open it, rather you had to push upward. However, the staff is super friendly, housekeeping staff especially. Theresa at the front desk was just fun to talk to. She mentioned that the orange bowel next to the fireplace totalt does not scream country, lol.

Text: The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and the breakfast was nice with a good variety. The pool was small, but clean and refreshing. The hot tub was relaxing.

Text: Easy to find off the highway. Room was immaculate, everything in good shape. Microwave, fridge, iron, coffeemaker in room, hot breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, french toast, etc). Comfy bed with extra pillows and blankets. Definitely will stay again.
