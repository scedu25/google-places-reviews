Text: Well besides the ants, veiled threats for beloved towels and late night partying it was an ok place. Laying down and looking at the ceiling I thought I was on LSD or something, weird wavy contours left you wonder how long the roof might stay in place. Perfect location for a slasher/kids camp movie. Fairly inexpensive, so if you need to crash for the night it will work. Oh did I forget to mention that the beds have more "swayback" than a 20 year old rented mule? Jeff

Text: This place was awesome. The staff at the hotel and the restaurant really know what customer service is. I am not an outdoor type but my wife and I will go back here just for a weekend because of the staff. Thanks for everything and my daughters wedding turned out great here.

Text: Food was good, steak was cooked as ordered, but not real tender, just a little tough, but more than acceptable.
