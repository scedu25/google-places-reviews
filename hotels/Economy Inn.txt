Text: Owners are nice. Just not happy with rooms. Reserved king non smoking and was put in a double bed smoking room. Owners did give us a refund.

Text: Clean room and comfy bed.  Great water pressure in the shower.  Friendly front desk clerk. Nice TV and fridge.  Only thing I would add is an extra lock on the door.   I would definitely stay here again.

Text: The guy at front desk was nice. When I asked about bed bugs he said we have not had any in a couple of months. It was the only hotel around so I did not have a choice so I took the room. I saw the room and had to ask for extra sheets to put on top of bed. It was not clean and even the textured ceiling was falling. I spent most of the night reading about bed bugs and how to spot if a room may have them. Worst experience I have had in a hotel.  I would strongly recommend passing this place up and just sleep in the car.  I got no sleep just because it was so gross.
