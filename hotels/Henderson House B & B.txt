Henderson House B & B
Rating: 5
Text: My boyfriend and I stayed here during the holidays and had the BEST experience! We stayed in the French Blue King Suite and let me tell you, the pictures on the website do not do it justice. It is gorgeous, we were in awe the second we walked in. The bathroom alone is the size of a standard hotel room, and let's not forget about the huge jacuzzi. But the highlight of our stay was the hospitality by Carlene and Jack. They were so kind and gracious, always making sure we had everything we needed. The house has so much living space with such a warm, cozy feel, I miss it already. I will most certainly be back and if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
