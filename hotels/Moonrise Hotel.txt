Moonrise Hotel
Rating: 4
Text: The hotel is great! I love the theme/decor. Our room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The rooftop bar is awesome too! I would definitely stay here again! The only thing that brought the experience down a little was the hotel restaurant. The staff was really nice, but it took forever to get our food. We actually left before we got everything we ordered. Hotel is great, though.

Text: Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooftop bar has a cool vibe with delicious cocktails. Eclipse restaurant has good food and provides 24hr room service. Rooms are clean, adorably moon themed, and have modern decor. Everything you would want and expect from a boutique hotel, in any city.

Text: I went to the moonrise as part of a bridal party getting ready for a wedding. The lobby and rooms are absolutely beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely look to book there in the future. P.S. I love the space theme!

Text: Terrible customer service experience. I booked a last minute one night stay through Kayak at $130.00 per night but upon arrival was informed that this was a government employee rate. I explained my situation and the front desk employee acknowledged it and went ahead with the reservation but NEVER MENTIONED A RATE CHANGE. I assumed that he made an exception and went ahead with the original rate. The room was $300.00 per night, RIDICULOUS! The advertisement of these false rates is borderline fraud and completely unacceptable. As far as the hotel goes, it's essentially a Best Western Plus with tacky disco lights. STAY AWAY
