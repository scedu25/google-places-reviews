Text: Booked our room online for an overnight stay on way back home from out west. Check in was fast & easy! Room was clean, cozy & very comfortable. We were hoping for a hot breakfast the next morning but was unsure of their continental breakfast choices. However was surprised & very thankful to get up the next morning to see they had cheesy eggs, biscuits, sausage gravy & so much more. Thank you Days Inn I70 Salina Kansas for a good night sleep & a hot breakfast! We'll definitely be back!

Text: My husband and I stopped here in our way through to Colorado. Very clean and great breakfast in the morning. Very good location. We booked through a third party website and ended up being charged twice. The hotel was able to refund our money for the double charge however.
