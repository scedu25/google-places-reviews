Hampton Inn & Suites Kansas City-Country Club Plaza

Text: Overall a good stay, but when we first arrived the man checking us in told us there would be an additional 20% charge. My friend specifically asked if this was a hold for damages twice, to which we were told that it was "a tax" on top of the tax included in our receipt (we booked through Hilton Honors). We asked two ladies at the front desk the next day and they were very clear that it was a hold for damages. Otherwise, good stay, although the walls were a little thin--one night we could hear two women in the room next to us talking in that intoxicated, slightly louder than normal but not shouting tone. The beds and pillows were clean and very comfortable. There were lots of towels in the bathroom.

Text: Staff is super nice and helpful. If you need anything, they are willing to go above and beyond to help! The room was nice and clean as was the rest of the hotel. Parking is very accessible. The kids absolutely loved the pool and the balcony off the pool! We will be staying there again for sure!

Text: This review is based on the entryway, Lobby, and conference rooms since this is what I was exposed to while visiting. this establishment had clean facilities, positive atmosphere, and space used appropriately. entry and exit a bit complicated since they were doing construction. Sufficient parking in the garage that's attached to the building

Text: A nice property in a great location where the staff is outstanding! The service and friendliness towards everyone makes for an excellent experience. Rooms are modern and clean. Some have mini kitchenettes and a suite with two rooms. The hotel has a free hot breakfast in an upscale setting that is spacious. There are also meeting rooms for a variety of functions. The hotel is a block away from the main Country Club Plaza area, so it is close enough to walk, but far enough you don't get the noise. The hotel has an indoor pool and fitness room, plus a parking garage underneath.

Text: Like most Hampton Inns, this hotel offers large rooms, comfortable beds, free coffee and a fantastic breakfast bar. We stayed over a busy weekend, so the free breakfast was a bit haphazard, but that's hard to predict I'm sure. Oh, and make sure you get there before 10. At 10am sharp, they start clearing the food. Back to the room...everything was clean, well appointed and comfortable. It's a great value for the central location!
