Super 8 Toledo
Rating: 4
Text: Very friendly family runs this older, very clean motel. Really quiet, very clean, and a great value. I wish every motel stay was like this. Free paper at front desk. $10 pet fee plus reasonable charge for room. Would also suggest this as an alternate for Grinnell and Marshalltown visitors in spring, summer or fall.

Text: Bed felt like i was sleeping in a bowl, . Had shades but no blinds so it was extremely bright in the room.  Other than that not a bad place.  Room was clean, receptionists were friendly,  had free breakfast and wifi

Text: Rooms looked nice and staff nice. Only reason for the rating were cockroaches.

Text: Hotel is clean, staff is very friendly.  I saw the reviews about bed bugs but had no such problem in my room. One problem is that there is NO fitness center which is contrary to what the website says. It appears to be under construction but staff says will not be done for a long time. All in all, a good place to stay for the price.
