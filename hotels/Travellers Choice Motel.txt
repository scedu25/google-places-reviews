Travellers Choice Motel

Text: DO NOT STAY HERE. Room smelled musty and like cigarettes. Staff lady was rude. She checked our room when we checked out and accused us of putting cigars???? Out on the carpet causing stains??? AND charged us without saying anything to us about it. The carpet was terribly stained before we even stayed in the room. The bed sheet also had burn marks in it. Also the location of this motel is not one I would recommend at all. I will never stay here again. She found a reason to charge us for damages!!! Probably because they can't afford to pay their bills!!!
