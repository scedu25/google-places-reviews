Best Western Corbin Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We found this location beautiful, and so very quiet.  Sleeping was no problem at all due to the quietness.  We didn't even hear neighboring rooms and the Inn was completely full! We will tell others about this hotel and recommend highly.

Text: Comfortable room but it was not cleaned well. Dust along all the baseboards in the rug.  Lamp bases and shades dusty. Behind bathroom door dusty.  Needed a good cleaning.

Text: Can't say enough about this little jewel.  Exceeded my expectations of a [non-high-end] hotel.  Everything was clean; the decor in the room was very nice, the outside well maintained. AND they accept pets!  Outside room entry made it easy to take them in and out. Wish I could have stayed longer; was only passing through. However, it's on my list for my next trip through KY.

Text: This hotel has made many improvements.  Decor and amenities are in the top ten now.  Especially breakfast, where hot biscuits, gravy, sausage and egg patties are available along with the usual toast and pastries, cereal and fruit.  We will definitely put it on our list.

Text: We stayed one night at this B/W on our way to Norwalk, Ohio.  Room was clean; beds were comfortable.  Internet was very slow and was almost un-usable.  We thought the Room Charge was a bit high for the area. Best part of this stay was Bubby's BBQ which was recommended by the Front Desk Clerk as a dinner place.  Best BBQ Buffet we've ever experienced!
