Text: I've vacationed here many times over the last 18 years and have always loved coming here. Our last visit was a total disappointment. Drove 3 hours to be told that the cabin did not have air conditioning. The second full day the temp was in the 90's and the cabin holds heat and really did not cool off until the early morning hours. For $175 a day I want air conditioning.  We were told that the air would be fixed on Tuesday (we arrived on Sunday) but it was never fixed and it would have been nice to hear something from the Felins but they really didn't seem to care and never tired to remedy the matter.  We ended up leaving one day early and lost $175. Vacations are fun but when you can't sleep comfortably  it just isn't what you want or need for your vacation time.

Text: My husband and I found this cabin on line and booked it for a short get-away.  I wished we would have booked it for a longer stay!  This cabin is PERFECT for couples and families who want to get away from the world.  Extremely quite, very secluded (perfect for couples).  The lake is crystal clear and perfect for swimming and fishing.  The cabin is adorable and very well taken care of.  The Jacuzzi was wonderful!  My favorite was the outdoor shower....so relaxing!  The night sky was full of stars.  We relaxed around the fire pit at night and listened to the wild life.  We saw deer and turkeys in the field....the nature was beautiful!  Owners are very friendly and sweet!  I highly recommend this cabin for anyone who needs to get away and relax!
