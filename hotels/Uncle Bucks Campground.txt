Uncle Bucks Campground
Rating: 5
Text: Me and my family stopped off here last year on our way from Philadelphia to Tulsa, we just needed a place to rest our heads for the night, so we got ourselves a section in this campground and I had the wife pitch the tents. Now we arnt rich by any means so we dont have the joy of sleeping on those fancy dancy pillow top mattresses but I would imagine that the ground I laid my head on that night was the closest I would ever come to it. The staff was very nice to my needs, my son has Trichotillomania and the man behind the counter didn't even second glance at the chunks of hair missing or him tugging at what little clumps were left. Well summer is right around the corner and this year we are looking to head out to the Basque Museum in Boise and figure why not jump on over to Uncle Bucks for another night of sleep. I can't thank Buck himself enough (if there really is an Uncle Buck)
