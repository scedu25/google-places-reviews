Text: Great place. It's a great place to stay we were made to feel very welcome. The rooms are clean and the manager special was a lot of fun. I will probably stay here a few more times

Text: The front desk was very nice, and informative. Rooms were very clean,and sanitary.  They also have smart TV and decent Internet speed. If you are a person that likes bright colors you will not liked the carpet.  It's dark green in some rooms and maroon in others. But myself, I don't care about carpet,  the necessaries are 5 star

Text: Good visit, in Kansas City for the first time. Coming in with my oldest brother for the Chiefs and Steelers game. Good visit, but didn't get a chance to take advantage of the amenities provided by the hotel. Room was decent for what we needed. Room does show some slight signs of wearing. Overall good facility.

Text: Pretty comfy room. Breakfast was good, and it was easy to get in and out of with the luggage cart.  Bolt did fall of of one while in use.  Staff was really nice.

Text: This hotel is very hot inside the rooms and in the hallways.  We thought our room had a broken air conditioner.  So we changed rooms.  This new room was only 3 degrees cooler.  It is 97 degrees outside and my hotel room is at 76 degrees.  I complained about how this hotel is hot and the rooms are hot...and the answer I got was...there is no air conditioner for the hallways of this hotel and that it is almost 100 degrees outside and that is why it is hot.   I just left 120 degrees heat in Arizona and that hotel had no problem keeping me cool.  This hotel has a pool but a inside pool.  Don't waste your money coming here.
