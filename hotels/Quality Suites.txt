Quality Suites
Rating: 4
Text: Location was very convenient. Rooms were very good. Comfy bed, great pillows. Water pressure was so so, not immaculate but plenty clean for me. Service was super friendly and free breakfast was a great bonus

Text: Nice and clean and comfortable. Amazingly friendly staff. Great accommodations. But the breakfast left something to be desired.

Text: The front desk staff was nice. Plenty of parking available. No elevator. The room was very musty smelling and the sheets looked old. You could see the yellow toned sweat stains. The smell and the bedding are the first things I notice in a room and I can't stand when it's not up to par. I would recommend spending an extra 10 bucks or so to stay somewhere better.

Text: DO NOT STAY HERE!  Non-existent staff.  Very rude when you can find them.  Fraudulent room charges.  Stayed 1 night while on the road.   My card was charged 3 times, and the 4th charge was declined by my card.  Very disappointing and unacceptable for a choice hotel.  Room was clean, breakfast was cold and inedible.

Text: Mold around the bathtub and across the ceiling over the window. I personally would not stay here again. Front desk was nice/friendly at arrival. The location of the hotel is very good.
