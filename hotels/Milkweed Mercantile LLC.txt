Text: This is completely one-of-a-kind and a must-experience for anyone interested in sustainable living. A gorgeous strawbale bed and breakfast in one of the most ecologically sustainable communities in the world. What an experience to stay here and enjoy the wonderful organic breakfasts, the good company, and the feeling that I am living in alignment with my core values.

Text: This bed and breakfast within the Dancing Rabbit Eco Village community was a wonderful place to stay while visiting a friend at Dancing Rabbit. The B&B owners, Kurt and Alline, were friendly and helpful. Kurt was our bartender one night and Alline cooked us an excellent breakfast each morning. The room was just what we were looking for. I look forward to seeing Kurt and Alline again, and to staying in the Milkweed Mercantile again if I ever get the chance.
