Text: The staff was friendly. The place was clean. The bed was soft and had a great sleep. The cookies, coffee, evening get together, and breakfast was great. The restaurant in front of the hotel is a barbeque theme. I will definitely stay here again.

Text: Always a great hotel to stay in.  The staff is great and the rooms are very comfortable.  The only issue is, they had Halloween decorations up on the outside and Christmas trees up inside.  It is the first part of November, so what about thanksgiving decorations first and Christmas decorations after Thanksgiving.

Text: An absolutely perfect hotel. Ive stayed here a few times for work. It is always clean. The staff are always smiling and friendly. Easily located off the interstate. The beds are super comfortable. Definately worth every penny.

Text: This is the first hotel that I'm definitely planning to stay at again on my cross country vacations.  The rooms are fantastic. Little things like reading lights (not lamps) on both sides of each bed and plenty of space for moving around make this a perfect place for my family. The pool area was prepared for guests with folded towels on each chair and rolled towels at each table. The breakfast area had very nice furnishings that were quite comfortable.  There is even a covered patio you could sit on and enjoy the morning.  I won't stay anywhere else in central Nebraska from now on.

Text: Stayed here while passing through on our way to Colorado. My daughter loved the pool, our king size room was the perfect size for her to play and enough room to put the crib on either side of the bed. The hotel staff was extremely pleasant and had a crib already in the room with the air conditioning on, which was a relief after being in the 90 plus degree heat. We had breakfast with plenty of options. We are going to check out the archway monument today before heading out and this was a convenient stop for us. We have never had a bad experience at a Holiday Inn Express. Would recommend this hotel for travelers.
