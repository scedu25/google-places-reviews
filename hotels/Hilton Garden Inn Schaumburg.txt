Text: My daughter and I stayed at this hotel recently and had a great experience.  The staff was amazing and the rooms were extremely clean.  Management handles all complaints with the highest level of professionalism no matter how small or big your complaint may be. I will definitely stay here again.

Text: Convenient location, modern rooms with very comfortable accommodations, and friendly staff made our stay a treat. Room service breakfast would be a welcome addition (room service is only available in the evening), though they do offer a made to order breakfast in the hotel.

Text: I had a really great experience with almost everything in the hotel. The only reason I'm doing 4 starts is that the pool is really quite small and there's no hot tub. Aside from that everything was great! We stayed 2 nights. I checked in online the day before and even picked out our room. The lobby is small, but decorated nicely with a small lounge and tables. The room was cozy and has all the essentials plus a few extras like microwave and fridge. The bed and pillows were comfortable. We wanted a couple of extra pillows and the front desk accommodated our request.  The room was quiet which was surprising since we were 2 rooms from the pool. I never heard any noises from the hallway. Every staff member that I spoke to was friendly and accommodating.  The hotel is just a 3-4 minute drive from Woodfield Mall and Lego Land. Our main destination was Lego land so this worked out perfect for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay here again.

Text: We come here every year for Labor Day weekend. Great staff and very friendly. We are currently staying here as I write this review. The only reason I gave this a 4 star review is because our beds in our room are like a rock. My wife and I hardly slept due to how firm it was even with the adjustments set to soft. I drove 10 hours to get here and hardly got any sleep.
