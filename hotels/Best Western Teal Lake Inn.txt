Best Western Teal Lake Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Highly recommend this hotel. Extremely clean every where we went including the pool area. Hot tub was not available as of October 2017. Breakfast was great. Worth the money!

Text: I reserved two rooms for two nights each. When making the reservation, they reserved 3 rooms for two nights each. Upon arrival, I was not allowed to cancel one room. I was billed for all three rooms for two nights each. The motel was full because of a High School homecoming in town. I was also informed that there was a waiting list for rooms, so my spare room, that I didn't need, should be given to somebody else. Whether it was or not I don't know, I just know that I paid for it.

Text: Although they were not staffed adequately enough, the one staff member there that I saw constantly, her name was Amy, she did an EXCEPTIONAL JOB of providing quality service to us all.

The rooms were cleaned and the sheets were changed after day two of our stay, the pool was a addition and the continental breakfast was exceptional considering the per night cost for the stay.

The next time we're in Mexico, MO we will definitely be staying at the Best Western!

Text: I give this hotel a 5, not because it's a top-end hotel, but because, for the price, it's a great bargain. It's clean, and amenities are updated. The beds were clean and comfortable. The pool was nice.  It was just what we needed to lay our weary selves down after 6 hours on the road. We'll stay again next time we're in the area.

Text: The hotel was clean, staff was wonderful, and the breakfast was good. The bed was hard, and what little sleep I got left me with back and hip pain.  5 stars for the hotel and 1 star for the bed.
