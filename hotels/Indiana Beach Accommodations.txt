Text: Lost acres was great!   The kids had a blast.   Indiana beach should measure all children at the gate.   We had a TON of discrepancies with height regulations!!!   A TON.   My child rode a water ride 16 times and then was told he was not tall enough, I was with him.  That seemed a little extreme.    What do I tell my 4 year old at that point?   ....that the park just doesn't know what it is doing?   ....or that they just don't agree between employees?     This happened again at the swings with my 5 year old...he was denied a ride after riding it all summer, multiple times.   I just feel things would go more smoothly if the measuring was at the gate.

Text: Horrible. Double booked our room, when we got to our room, 7 cleaning staff were hanging out and slammed the door shut on us when we tried to go in, and they lost our ticket at the restaurant. I'd have had more fun with Netflix and chill.
