Archway Campground

Text: I'm driving cross-country so I'm only staying overnight places so I'm not big on a million amenities since I don't have the time to use them but the owner seemed very nice and it's a very pretty spot with a really reasonable price.

Text: A campground with minimal and low quality amenities. Great for elderly folks looking for a quiet escape. Not so much for families with little ones. The owner is an absolute tool! He is the reason I will never go back.

Text: Wow,  may I just say I felt like we had landed in the twilight zone.  First night nice and quiet.  Not much to do there so we left and went swimming and shopping,  thought we would have our family over for dinner that night.  My brother and his wife went fishing in the half empty pond and happened to catch a bass.  It swallowed the hook and died.  My nephew brought it to me and I said well just put it in the creek so not to contaminate the pond.  All &%^&* broke loose after that.  The owner and his wife sped up to our camper on their little red scooter and began a tirade that did not end for almost 15 full minutes.  He pointed at my brother, who apologized profusely, and kept saying that someone could eat that fish and this was a catch and release pond.  We offered to pay for the fish and this was not good enough.  He continues speeding over to the neighboring campers talking with them then coming back to yell some more.  We finally got the fish out of the creek and took it to the other campers.  They taunted my nephew and said "that's not even a big one".  They continued to stare down my family as they were trying to enjoy dinner and play on  the one swing set that was there.  Also, we were told not to run our air conditioner with the vent open.  It was our bathroom vent.  I have never met such unfriendly people in my life and I have been camping my whole life.   The bathroom was nice, that is the only positive I  can say.  Oh and that my husband who is quick to anger, kept his cool and did not aggravate the scene which I had a hard time with myself.  Just remember, if you camp there as the owner kept saying,  "THIS IS MY CAMPGROUND AND MY RULES!!!!
