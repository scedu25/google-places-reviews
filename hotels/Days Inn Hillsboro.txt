Days Inn Hillsboro
Rating: 4
Text: Rooms are recently renovated. Much nicer than they used to be. There are still some cosmetic issues that need to be fixed such as furniture and paint. The bed is still only in okay condition. Not as comfortable as other beds I slept on. The water pressure in the bathroom is remarkable. Overall. It is decent for what I need.

Text: Room apparently renovated recently. Very dusty, unfinished, paint spills on the floor. A/C was dirty. Woke up with swollen eyes. Apparently from the dust and paint fumes. Carpeting on stairs and back hall not vacuumed in a while. Mistake to stay. Don't recommend.

Text: Clean and friendly. Undergoing up-grades but not interfering w services.  Handy to fast food, steak house. Bob Evans, WalMart and Lowes. The best Hillsboro has to offer,

Do NOT believe reviews that state there are bed bugs and mold here. I insisted on inspecting rooms for cigarette smell , bugs and mold because I  very sensitive to allergies. There was not a trace of any and the linens and shower curtain were immaculate.
