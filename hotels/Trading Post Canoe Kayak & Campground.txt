Trading Post Canoe Kayak & Campground
Rating: 4
Text: We reserved an electric tent site for four people a couple months ago and were told that almost all the river side sites were open. When we arrived someone was parked on our site. Our site was downhill and made for an inclined sleep. We would have rather been in a flatter site. 
The TP was mostly friendly and accommodating. The drop off for kayaking was on time and easy to follow directions. The 13 mile trip was amazing with only two Portage spots. Quite a bit of trash was in the river from people who lost beer cans or flip flops mostly. Sad to see such a beautiful river being destroyed by irresponsible vacationers. 
It would be nice if someone kept up with all the fallen trees and moved them out of the river. 
As for the Trading Post, my biggest recommendation is having more than 2 showers and more than two bathrooms for such a large amount of people that you can accommodate. Not everyone wants to use port o potties.
