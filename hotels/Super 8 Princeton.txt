Text: Clean enough. Hasn't been remodeled in years. Breakfast lacks any protein options. Pastries and cereal only. Housekeeping is rude and bangs on your door at 8 am Saturday morning and complains you aren't it of the room. If you have left anything on a bed, that bed will not be touched. This includes a pillow brought from home. Stingy with towels.

Text: The hotel was clean. How ever the front desk clerk was extremely shaddy and try to get me to help him scam the website that I made the reservations through. I will NEVER return to this Super 8 ever again.
