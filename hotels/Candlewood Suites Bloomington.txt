Text: Great room!  Clean, comfortable, and the amenities are top notch.  The fitness center actually has weights!!  It's not simply an aerobics room.

Text: Absolutely wonderful place to stay, especially for longer than a couple nights. Rooms are large and spacious with comfortable furniture and set-up. Complete with stove, dishwasher, and full size refrigerator. Modern style and tons of complimentary amenities. I will most definitely stay here anytime I am in town.
