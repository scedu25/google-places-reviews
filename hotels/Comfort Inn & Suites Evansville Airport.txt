Text: I cannot overstate how nice the stay here was. The entirety of the hotel is clean from hallways, parking lot, lobby, the rooms. The staff is so friendly and professional. The breakfast they serve is amazing. They have a staff cooking a mini buffet that is delicious! Will stay again!

Text: Traveled into Evansville to funeralize my Aunt. I loved the bereavement rate idea. There are a lot of hotels that don't offer that. The hotel was clean. Did not get an opportunity to eat breakfast, but  other family members did and they said the food was good and hot. Thank you Comfort Inn for taking such good care of us. One last thing I want to mention.  We arrived before check-in time and we needed to get dressed before the funeral service. Because they had the room available, they allowed us to check-in early. This was the cherry on top for me. Thank you again for taking such good care of us!
