Text: We left in 2 seconds flat after finding bed bugs in the chair. The staff understood and refunded the money with no problem. I have no idea how to add the video but willing to share it!

Text: I’m only giving them a one star because it won’t let me go any lower than that. I paid for three nights, almost $200 for bedbugs, moldy ceilings, dust behind the bed. I also made it VERY aware that I had my dog with me. Well on day two they locked me out of my room saying I needed to pay $100 for my dog being there. Uhhhh what????? And then the dude got rude and said my card that I had on file was a fraud. Uh no my bank just doesn’t let me overdraw and they took the last of my money so I agreed to pay it when I checked out.  Well they have since then made two different charges to my debit card when I checked out early this morning. I’ve called to see what’s going on, and they claimed my dog destroyed the room. My dog is a service dog and was never once left alone. So now I’m short $300 because they’re greedy assholes. Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra to stay at a Hampton inn where at least you’ll get treated with respect.

Text: Do not make in room coffee! I ran just straight water through the coffee maker..not once...but 5x! And the coffee makers are so dirty, the bottom of my cup was full of chunks and what looked like dirt. I gave up. Never got the water to run clean. And breakfast area is disgusting! There was food and syrups all over the tables...so many food crumbs and god knows what on the floor that it officially was turning into grout! Splashed milk and juice running down fronts of cabinets. Thank god for the McDonalds next door!!
