Text: Great place with very large rooms and antique decor. The people are great and breakfast was awesome. We had a great time at the pub and walking the shops downtown!

Text: We found out about the B&B the first time visiting Weston and have wanted to stay ever since. I'm so glad we were finally able to spend the night. Kenna was an amazing host and chef. She was very welcoming and was eager to get to know us both on a personal level. Her breakfast was very unique and delicious. Already planning to visit again in the fall!!

Text: We stayed in the Scottish themed room, which had a long sword in it! The room is incredibly huge, with a love seat, electric fireplace (I think, we didn't use it), queen sized bed and decorations fitting for the theme. Our host and chef (same person, Chef Kenna) is a fantastic chef! Our breakfast was full of flavors and plated beautifully. We will definitely go back for another night, or weekend stay!

Text: This bed and breakfast is quite the unique getaway. We were the first to arrive so we took a peak at the 4 creatively themed rooms. The attention to detail in the decorations and the amenities was impressive. The Irish love poems book next to our comfortable bed was a nice touch. We especially enjoyed the chimenea under the pergola and the hot tub. The next morning we were quite impressed by the deliciously prepared brunch. We will definitely return.

Text: A great place to stay for a getaway. Our room was very spacious and elegant and the breakfast was great. The whole property is well maintained and the hosts are extremely friendly. The only small issue we had is it is right next to the pub, which was great when we went there, however not so great the next night when we retired a little earlier. Patrons from the pub were quite loud outside after it closer. We are both light sleepers, though. We would definitely come back.
