Kamp Modoc Family Campground & Play Lake
Rating: 5
Text: We bought our very first camper just before the 4th of July Weekend; and decided to go to Kamp Modoc for the holiday weekend.  We were very impressed with the store, bathroom and shower facilities; and the employees.  Had a great time here.  Very kid friendly.

Text: Staff was great, bathhouse at office is brand new, other bathhouse clean and in good shape. lake is filled with toys for play. $10 wristband is worth every penny! playground was fun and in great shape. Wagon rides for the kids throughout the day was fun.  Full service sites were inexpensive in comparison to other campgrounds.  We will definitely return here. WiFi and phone signal were nearly nonexistent,  but not that big of a deal to us.

Text: I payed for a month to stay at kamp modoc and from beginning owner blamed us for my dogs going to bathroom in restrooms and kept blaming my grandson for different things. And he kicks us out and keeps all my money. Please do not bring any kids that have mental disabilities here.the restroom water is never hot to shower and I am disabled with nerve damage so I couldn't shower. My advice is to find another park. Oh and by the way if ur going to accuse a child of shooting a person with a bb gun u might wanna check if its broke or not which it was when he got it at dollar store. And then to threaten me to get rid of my grandson or leave is not ok period.
