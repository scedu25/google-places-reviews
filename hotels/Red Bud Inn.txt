Red Bud Inn
Rating: 5
Text: Our room was clean and reasonably priced. The owner is great with customer service and does well at maintaining the inn. This was our second stay and I would recommend it for folks visiting Nashville, IN and the surrounding area. It's only a few minutes from Nashville.  The room was a little small, but with just my wife and I on this trip, it was plenty of space for the two of us.
