Text: They are not clear with what is included: dump station, electric and water hook ups at about a dozen sites on the river bank and a variety of other tourist services on site.  This campground is part of the day use area with picnic areas etc.  The RV sites with electric are located on the river bed, some are grass and gravel and some are on asphalt (or what is left of it.)  This is immediately adjacent to the cavern tour, zip line and the canoe service.  A great place for the price.  Very quiet in the off season now.  The Meramec river is very clean and pristine as it flows past the site.

Text: A good, inexpensive campground near Meramec Caverns. Has a small beach, shower area, even the motel across the street if you're not able to enjoy nature. Note though that due to its location, expect phone reception to be choppy.
