Four Points by Sheraton Columbus Ohio Airport
Rating: 4
Text: Great value near the airport. No free breakfast, but fast food options within walking distance and the on-site restaurant makes good food. Spacious fitness center, modern and comfortable rooms with good beds.

Text: Great hotel near the airport.  Free transportation to/from the airport and they have a park and fly option for a daily fee, which is much cheaper than if you park at a normal airport parking lot.  Room rates are right in line with what a 3-Star hotel should be.  The hotel was modern, very clean and comfortable for traveling through Columbus.  Front desk staff was very good and attentive to our needs.  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the barn-door style bathroom door, my three year old couldn't open or close it by herself.  Not sure if it was a heavy door or it was rubbing against the adjacent wall.  All in all I'd recommend staying here.

Text: I was just visiting to pick up a friend who was staying there. She seemed to like the hotel. The lobby was nice, and the parking was convenient.
