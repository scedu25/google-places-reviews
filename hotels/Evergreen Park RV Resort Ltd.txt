Text: Second time we've been here. The park is kept up very nicely. The pool is clean and maintained. It is a few bucks more than other places, but worth it for the extras. Nice location in the Amish.

Text: Indoor pool and hot tub were great, laundromat is the best I've seen. Favorite place every fall. Could use a dog park or dog run and more sites.

Text: This is one of the best built and cared for parks I’ve seen. Unfortunately their WiFi is almost nonexistent. I stayed there 4 days and was not able to send and receive emails. It wasn’t a matter of getting the signal at my site. They have plenty of repeaters. It was the signal coming into the park that was the problem. I sat in the front office one day and still couldn't get on. The staff to,d me it was caused by others abusing the system by downloading movies etc... But I was not able to use the internet my entire 4 day stay, day or night.
