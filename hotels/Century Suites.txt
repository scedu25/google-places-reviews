Text: Very happy with the quality and customer service! I had a gift certificate that was purchased at a silent auction and we were very close to the expiration date. Ian worked with me and even suggested that the date could be extended if necessary. Fortunately, one of my daughters was able to use it AND SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND HAD A WONDERFUL TIME!   They were upgraded to a king suite on top of it all. Pure class. Thank you Ian and Century Suites! Everything was clean, beautiful, and above our expectations!!

Text: Nice ambiance in the rooms. The best way I can describe it is "quaint". Each room is like a mini-house. However, the Internet speed is very slow. About 2 Mbps when I could connect. Another guest at the suites had the same issue with internet speed.

Text: Never stayed at a place life this before. It's a village of little houses, so it's kinda cool. The suite was clean and very spacious and the staff was very friendly and courteous.

Text: When I realized just now that I'd left a bunch of items in the room in my haste to get somewhere i called century suites.  I was told to call back in ten minutes. I callled now for hours to be hung up on and ignored. When I had first realized I'd left a pillow the lady was very helpful. However upon realising the additional items I've left, the man attending tonight can only ignore my calls.  I am very sad about very expensive items I've likely lost, but he could care less.

Text: Here for a conference; incredible. Clean, spacious, and a guest bathroom?? Beds are a bit hard though, and I heard some cottages don't get the Wi-Fi.
