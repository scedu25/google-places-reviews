Text: Very nice clean hotel with wonderful front desk service and friendly cleaning staff. Also one of the best breakfasts we've had(though I'll never understand why the butter and cream cheese is in the frig for those 3 hours it's open. But every hotel does it) The price was very good and it was 3 miles from Iowa State and we were there for a volleyball game. We forgot our suits but the pool and whirlpool looked very nice. However, they allow pets which I do not agree with and have no idea why hotels allow them. Why do I want to listen to your dogs yip? Otherwise, it was great.

Text: We have stayed at this motel a couple different times and we have always found it to be very clean but the staff is what has made us want to come back.  They are very friendly and willing to help with any questions.  I left my credit card at a eating place we had just been to.  When I noticed it was missing when I was checking in at the front desk,  the staff immediately offered to call he eating place for me to see if they had it.

Text: Very nice hotel! It manages to be both comfortable and stylish at the same time. The people are friendly and helpful. There are loads of nice, cozy places to hang out with family, both inside and outside. Breakfast was good, and there was plenty of seating. I highly recommend it!

Text: This breathtaking beautiful hotel has been recently renovated and is stunning! The welcoming lobby immediately makes you feel like home away from home. The rooms are gorgeous, very clean and well kept. The included homemade breakfast is superior quality with a plethora of choices for any dietary needs or desires. My spouse states this is the best value breakfast anywhere and he travels frequently!!! This hotel is a great place to gather as family or for business meetings. The staff is attentive and ready to serve you.Every time we need a place to stay while traveling, this is our first choice. You will not be disappointed! You may want to make this your destination and weekend get away for no reason at all.

Text: The room was clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was decent and we enjoyed the noon check out.   There was a pool and gym that we did not have time to utilize but they looked like they were nice size.
