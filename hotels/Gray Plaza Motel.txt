Gray Plaza Motel

Text: I stayed there on the 5th of September and the room was so dark and gloomy. A light was out but they did change it immediatly. The toilet didn't work. i had to turn on the water to it and turn it off when I was done because it would keep on running. The cushion to the ugly dirty couch would sink in when I sat on it. It would help a lot just to paint it white. Thank goodness it wasn't more than 50 bucks. They were very nice but the room was aweful.

Text: This is a roach and bedbug infested hotel with hateful staff, am EXTREMELY crappy breakfast, and dirty linens. Their WiFi service   is well below par for even the average user.i witnessed drug paraphernalia littered in the parking lot, the shower was useable with shower shoes on, but the shower head was clogged. The toilet ran after flushing and I was nervous about the door lock. It seemed to semi lock. Never stay there again ! I gave it one star too many.

Text: A basic motel experience, staff was friendly and helpful in exchanging rooms when AC in first room was non-functional, condition of buildings reflects the age and the price being paid for room; although sign says breakfast is provided, there was no indication of any food being made available in the morning when we were checking out at about 8:00 and no mention made by staff person about any food we could have before we left.

Text: Bad place to stay. I JUST HAVE TO ADD MORE TO THIS REVIEW. I HAVE A FRIEND THAT IS STAY AT THIS MOTEL, I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT I SAW WHEN I WENT INTO HIS ROOM,IT WAS WORSE THAN BAD , JUST HORRIBLE, AND ALL OF THE ROOMS LOOK LIKE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CLEANED, AND THE POLICE ARE ALWAYS THERE GETTING PEOPLE FOR DRUGS AND ALL KINDS OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. I'LL NEVER STAY THERE. THEY ARE NOT CHEEP PRICED ON TOP OF IT ALL. ALL I HAVE TO SAY
