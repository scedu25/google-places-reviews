Text: Great place to unwind and get back to nature. The park is right on Paint Creek so you can grab a kayak or tube and enjoy the day floating or simply grab a chair and a drink and watch others float by. It is a typical primitive camp ground, they do care for it, there is indoor plumbing for toilet and shower which was clean everytime we used it. A camp store was available a small playground as well as shuttle up the river and life jackets you could use.

Text: Nice enough rural location, but hot damn, was this place noisy at night. Drum circle with lots of whooping and hollering until at least 3am. Go here if you want to party all night long, but it's not a place for relaxing camping.

Text: Just a nice place to relax around the campfire. Kayak rentals are available for floats down Paint Creek.  Favorite weekend destination for locals!
