Text: This place is definitely NOT for primitive tent camping. Unless you're a fan of teens on ATVs driving through your campsite at all hours of the night screaming and yelling. Finally we had enough and looked outside of our tent at 2:00am and there were FOUR ATVs surrounding our tent barely 10 feet from us. There were people surrounding my car, and my tent. I had to yell at them to get them to leave! It seemed to me like they were trying to steal from us since when they were caught I watched them walk away from my car. We even recorded them driving away. It was terrifying seeing as that I'm very pregnant camping alone with my mother and 5 year old niece. We called the man on duty and he completely blew it off and blamed it on "the neighbors"... riiigght. So we packed up and left at 2am. He refused to provide a refund, or apology. He even left a voicemail on our phone cussing and screaming, very professional... 

Also, the pool was foggy full of grass and crumbling apart.
