Text: My 3 girlfriends & I had a horrible experience at this B & B & the owners were not interested in trying to resolve it. One of the 2 ladies was rude when we spoke to her throughout the weekend. We had no heat & limited electricity all weekend. The rooms were very cold, the radiators were cold to the touch but the owners insisted that the heat was on. With the exception of a short time on Sat afternoon, the radiators were stone cold. And there was an issue all weekend with circuit breakers tripping, resulting in no electricity, with the exception of the overhead light. No lamps, no tv, no outlets to charge phones, no electric heater that usually enhances the radiator heat. Upon checkout, we were charged more than the price we were quoted over the phone. Apparently they failed to give us a price that included all the extra charges. They were not interested in negotiating the cost, despite our problems all weekend. Aunt Sally brought us the bill & we asked her to split it 4 ways so we could each pay our share & she refused, saying that was way too much trouble. So one of us had to put the entire $800 charge on our credit card. I called the owner back on Monday to talk about all this & the best she could offer was a discount if we come back! Seriously??You think we would come back?. Two positives: the breakfast was great & the house pretty but you can find that at a hundred other places.

Text: An interesting and comfortable place to stay for those looking for a historical B&B experience. There is plenty of relaxing porch seating and a large yard with a hot tub if you plan on spending some time outside. The inside and outside of the mansion are well kept and it's not too hard to imagine former presidents Lincoln and Grant enjoying their visits here. The rooms are nicely furnished and match the quaint tone of the property. Breakfast was good and consisted of the kinds of food I would associate with a B&B. Current management Aunt Sally and Bets are welcoming and friendly.

Text: Charlie and Rita were the perfect hosts - they met us at the door, showed us to rooms that have to be seen to be appreciated - all the amenities of 2015, but the charm, beauty and luxury of 1860.  The location is perfect - two short down hill blocks to the main busy main part of town - all listed on the National Registry.  Breakfasts second to none, served by Rita and Charlie - followed by a short history of the Mansion and Galena.  They anticipate needs, but do not hover.  We stayed two nights - next time will be at least  three - just to enjoy the hot tub, the English gardens and the warmth of a genuine welcome.  Recommend this beautiful home without reservation.

Text: We came up to Galena for the last Mistletoe Ball and this was the absolute best B&B ever!!  Such an incredibly beautiful home, very warm and charming.  Charlie and Rita were the nicest hostesses and full of history of Galena!  Rita made a fantastic breakfast!  Charlie and Rita treated us like they've known us for years :)  Cannot wait to come back!!
