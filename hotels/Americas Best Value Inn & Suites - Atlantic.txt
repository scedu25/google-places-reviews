Text: They were able to accommodate us with and extra night on a couple hours notice which was great. Basic hotel, big rooms, nice pool and hot tub. Mostly clean. Beds are hard and it's noisy. Good hotel for a short stay

Text: Easy to get to, decent parking close to your room. The motel recently jumped chains from Super8 to America's Best Value Inn which is usually a bad sign but in this case there has been no loss of quality. Clean rooms that have been updated (we've stayed here many times) Firm beds, but the walls are a little thin. Flat screen TV, fridge, hair dryer, iron, ironing board. Breakfast bar with cereal, coffee, tea, biscuits and gravy and waffles. We bring a water test kit and the pool tested out great, maybe a little heavy on the chlorine. This place has been owned by the same people for years and they take pride in their Inn. Coming back for Thanksgiving 2017. Jeff

Text: We often stay here when visiting the area. The rooms are clean and it is conviently located. New management is friendly and attentive to guest needs. The hot tub is a great place to relax while kids splash out extra energy in the pool. One drawback was no non grain options in the continental breakfast. Some fruit would be a great choice to add.

Text: Great place to stay!   Staff is friendly,  place is very clean,  and the manager is hands down one of the best we have ever dealt with!   Not only is she a directory of local services, she is also genuinely there for anything you need.  We will definitely stay here anytime we return to Atlantic!
