Text: Lovely room. Very comfortable bed and plenty of outlets. Bathroom also nice. Biggest complaints were food: no free breakfast, overpriced in-house "bistro", and no good food nearby.

Text: Nice enough, but no complimentary coffee? Weak.  Sure I could make it in my room but that is always garbage coffee and you never know what the last guest used the machine for.  Maybe they cooked meth in it. I don't know.

Text: Don't stay here on an unexpected trip. You would think for their price that they would have some complimentary toiletries for guests. I couldn't get an extra shampoo or conditioner for the room,got charged $2 for a toothbrush.  Customer care and service was non- existent. Never stay there again.
