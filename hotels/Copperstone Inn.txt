Text: In July of 2009 my wife and I were looking to take a weekend vacation to escape our busy Chicago lifestyle.  We have visited Lake Geneva and Galena and were very pleased, but after discovering Copperstone we decided to give it a try.  We could not have been more impressed!!  Its hard to believe you could find such beautiful country only 1 1/2 hours away.  You will not find more luxurious rooms and amentities, and the staff was extremely helpful and ready to wait on us at every request.  When the weekend was over we were completely refreshed and ready to take on the world.  If you are looking for that perfect weekend getaway for your wife and family, look no further.  Not to mention its closer than Lake Geneva and Galena as well.  5 stars, and we can not wait to get back!
