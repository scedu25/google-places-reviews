Text: This is a very nice small family owned resort. Better than a crowded state Park campground.  We have owned it since I was 16. Quiet time is 11pm for our older guest that come in. The cabins are to sleep in so if your from the city and don't like the country life don't come. Great place for kids. The river does get high and we do not want anyone hurt on the river so we only float when the river is just right. Love our little place and we book up fast since all our regular guest love us so much.

Text: Very poor experience here.  It is a very small place. The owners are rude.  We were not told what quiet time was upon arrival then we're yelled at.  We were told no one was floacting due to the river being high but then they let another group float twice.  Very poor experience not worth the 3 hour drive. Would not recommend this place to anyone ever!
