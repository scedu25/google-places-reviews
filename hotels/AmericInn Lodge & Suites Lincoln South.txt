Text: This hotel was super clean, friendly and affordable. The front desk staff granted every request our party of six asked for including an extra bed, more pillows and even took photos for us! The pool was great, the hot tub was hot and bubbly, breakfast was amazing, and an around the clock coffee bar all for around $100 a night made our stay so carefree and value packed! Thanks AmericInn!

Text: The staff is very nice but the room was dirty. The sheets and pillows had hair on them and the floor needed vacuuming. I would highly recommend staying in another hotel if you value cleanliness.

Text: This location is showing its age. Room had sustained major water damage under window and it was just painted over. Frendly staff.

Text: My booking afforded me a two queen bed lodging. The room was cozy, and had freshly made beds and a very clean bathroom/sink area. The beds had white sheets and were garnered with three pillows each. Plenty of breathing room for two to four guests, Contained aside a desk and a 27 inch TV with basic cable package sat on a large one drawer wide dresser. Service was prompt to let us in after I gave them a last name and the make, model and state of the car. Continental breakfast was limited to omelettes , orange/apple juice, quart of milk, and three varieties of breakfast cereal. Over all, for the price paid ($99) was a great experience.
