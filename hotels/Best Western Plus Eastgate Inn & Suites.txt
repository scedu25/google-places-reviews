Best Western Plus Eastgate Inn & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: High quality Best Western where the "Plus" is evident.  Good east Wichita location though access is not easy right now because of road work.  Daily paper provided, Pool looks good but we didn't use it.  Normal wide breakfast selection.  Close by parking.  Quiet, even on side facing the highway!

Text: So impressed with this hotel! The staff was very friendly, the room was clean, and the bed was so comfortable.  We got a great night's sleep - the best ever in a hotel, actually. The gentleman at the front desk offered to move our room to the back of the hotel so we'd have less noise in the morning. Also, the breakfast was great! Would definitely recommend and will be staying there again when we pass through Wichita!

Text: We were traveling they Wichita & needed a one night stay. This hotel was just off 35 & quick to get to. We had it prepaid & check in was a quick 5 min @ 11:00 pm. Clean & comfy beds made this an excellent choice. Well worth the price point.

Text: I've stayed here many times. Conveniently located close to I-35 and US-400. There's quite a few quality restaurants close by, some within walking distance. It has an indoor pool, good breakfast, and friendly, helpful staff. Rooms are comfortable and quiet with mini fridges and microwaves for longer stays.
