Text: If i could give it a negative star i would. I wouldn't have paid $20 to stay here had i not had anywhere to go. Got charged $80 for a room, which was old and run down. Told the front desk that we only needed somewhere to rest our heads until 9am because where we were staying fell through.  I thought by checking in at midnight that maybe we d get a discount,  absolutely not. I paid the same for my 4 star hotel in Chicago through priceline.  Do not stay here, you wont even go under the covers in this place!

Text: Unfortunately I had to stay at this place for two weeks for the money that they want it's not even worth half of it I don't know where all the reviews are of a place to eat or coffee or orange juice cuz there's nothing like that here they'll put you in a room where you will not sleep at all because it's not concrete floors on the ground level and upstairs it's all rickety wood if you want to put a bar in a hotel then spend the extra money and get soundproof doors soundproof walls and soundproof floors I literally called every single night and asked to turn the bar music down every single night you hear who's outside bullshiting every single night you hear cars coming by that's not a place to go to sleep
