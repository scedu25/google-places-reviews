Text: Our family of 7 was having a hard time to finding a cabin that would accommodate us. I'm so thankful we found Southern Comfort. All 5 kiddos had plenty of room to spread out and explore. The cabin was beautiful and exactly as pictured. We cannot wait to come back!!!!

Text: I just spent 3. 5 days & 3 glorious nights at The Woodsman cabin.  I loved the front porch and the cabin's private wooded lot.  Each cabin sets way away from the others, so they're not crowded on top of one another.  The amenities of the cabin were very nice.  Ceiling fans, washing machine & dryer, dish washer, walk in shower, very very comfortable beds, satellite TV, Internet (yes, even in the hills of Red River Gorge), outdoor grill, hot tub, ceiling fan on front porch, dining table & chairs on front porch.  It was sooo peaceful, relaxing & beautiful.  Dale, the owner is very accommodating.  Loved my stay with here with my grown sons.

Text: Spacious and secluded cabin in the beautiful foothills of the Red River Gorge. Came with a group of friends and had an absolute blast. The large wrap around porch and the hot tub really made it that much better. Also proximity to hiking and rock climbing made this the perfect spot. Definitely recommend to anyone

Text: A group of friends and I stayed in the Southern Comfort cabin. It is an awesome, spacious cabin that sits perfectly in the hills. The hot tub and wrap around porch made it great for entertaining and star gazing. Hope to be back soon!
