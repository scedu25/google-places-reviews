Text: Don't stay here for any Fun Fest events.  Shaw, the owner manager will STEAL your $50.00 deposit with magical unwritten rules if you need to cancel a reservation.  I gave them a one full weeks notice and was not given a refund.  Our whole car club have been staying at his roach motel for 15 years.  Smelly smelly rooms. Don't trust this idiot.

Text: The air conditioner barely worked, the door card reader stopped working, meaning we always had to keep someone in the room, and the breakfast was sad. The room was fairly clean, but there was dirt in odd places. If you're on a budget, it will do, but there are better options available in the area.

Text: Beds and bathroom were clean. It was an "ok" place to stay for an over night quick stop but I wouldn't stay multiple nights at the price I paid.  It needed some repair. Carpets appeared dirty, ceiling had spots on it from leaks. Front desk was curtious and helpful. Also I liked that the mattresses were  completely enclosed in a full mattress zipped sealed cover and the beds were comfortable.

Text: A decent hotel with friendly service. It looks a little shabby but most of it works properly. The wifi was noticably difficult to connect to. The free breakfast was slightly fresher and offered more choices than is average for this price tier. Overall a decent place to rest for one night on a long road trip, if you're not picky and you get a good deal on your reservation.
