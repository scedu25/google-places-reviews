Text: Great place for the kiddos and mine are 10 and 8. We were able to use the indoor water park at 1pm on the day of check-in. The place was busy, so only one of our rooms were ready. The other one wasn't ready until 3:45. I know check-in isn't until 4, it would have just been easier if my room would have been done a little sooner! Rooms were nice and clean. Kids loved the bunk bed. Haley at the front desk was one of the most helpful customer service people I have experienced. She was so kind and informative with us when we checked in and the next day when we checked out! I appreciate Haley and all she did to make our stay a great one! Thank you!

Text: Nice resort, especially for the area. Friendly staff at check in. Nice room, which ours was the family suite. Conveniently located to Cedar Falls, which is about 4 miles away. Just remember, it's all about the kids at Great Wolf, so not a good place to plan on getting any peace and quiet (especially after 8:30am). At least the water park has an adult whirlpool area. If you are not traveling with kids, try to avoid the room ending in numbers 39-48, because they closer to the elevators and stairs.

Text: Excellent place to stay. Staff is great and rooms were clean and ready to go. Geared towards younger kids but enough entertainment for all ages. Bars/restaurants for adults as well as an adult only hot tub. Food prices are your typical resort prices. There are a multitude of restaurants and fast food chains within a mile drive and even more within a 2.5 mile drive. The location is perfect.

Text: Went for a long weekend vacation. 6 year old loved the water park. Rooms were nice, but we never had housekeeping come to our room for some reason the entire stay. Magic Quest was malfunctioning which bummed my daughter out quite a bit. When the staff was informed of this issue they didn't attempt to do anything about it, just "we'll let IT know". Lots of fun Halloween activities for the kids as well. Paw Pass turned out to be a nice value, but your mileage may vary depending on what your kids like to do.

Text: We visited this weekend. The water park was pretty good, they allowed by 4 year old to ride lots of things that some places don't. They are safe but friendly there. There's a guy who works in the arcade, named Cody.. he was kind of quieter like my daughter. She was having a tough time with something and he was AMAZING with helping her out. Kudos to Great Wolf for hiring that guy. We will definitely be back.
