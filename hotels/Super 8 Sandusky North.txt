Super 8 Sandusky North

Text: Old and a bit run down. Was just ok for cleanliness. It was difficult to know if things were unclean or just old. Low water pressure from showers. We did not have breakfast there so I can't comment on that. They had semi parking which was helpful for us.

Text: Needs upgrading! Fridge and microwave NOT in every room. Breakfast is very slim pickings of cereal, donuts, and if your lucky waffles. Service could use improvement. Only good thing was a Wal-mart in walking distance.

Text: Worst Motel ever. 
Have visited several Motels over many years,  but this was the worst ever seen.  Stinky, dirty and smelly smoky Room, last renovation maybe in the 60s. Planned 2 days after 1 day cancelled.  Even after room-change uninhabitable. Never ever again

Text: The people at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean. I would have to just say maybe some updating and maybe a microwave and mini fridge would have been nice. I would stay there again.
