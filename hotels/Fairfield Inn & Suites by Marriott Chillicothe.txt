Text: We had a great experience at this hotel!! The rooms were immaculate, a great fitness center that we used during our stay. The best part of the stay was the staff -- they were all (without exception) very friendly and helpful during out stay. The ladies that were in attendance for the morning complimentary breakfast were outstanding. If something was needed (like more fresh strawberries), they went and checked for more and brought them to our table. They were very friendly and cheerful to everyone. We would definitely stay here again!! Great job to all the staff that we encountered during our stay!!
