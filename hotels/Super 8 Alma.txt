Super 8 Alma
Rating: 3
Text: Only three motels in Alma, so this might be the better one, but our king room smelled terrible. The rooms are non-smoking. We turned on the a/c which was off and within the hour the smell was better, but holy cow! If we'd had another choice of hotels we would have gone elsewhere. All the eateries/ restaurants in town are closed by 10pm so if you're coming in late, forget about food. The only good part about our stay was that the bed was comfy.

Text: If you're looking for a clean comfortable room this is the place.  If the free breakfast means anything to you, you'll likely be disappointed.  There is not a single hot item on the counter and everything is just full of sugar.  However, there is a cafe a block or two to the north and on the other side of the road that has GREAT home cooked breakfast at a reasonable price.

Text: Nice receptionist at front desk.    No elevator.  Seems to be an hotel for hunters during hunting season?   I saw rv and camper hook up in parking lot as well.  Not sure if allow stay in camper during hooked up?   Impressive waffle mix the only hotel that i liked waffles from so far,  it seems to be made in small batches instead of from an big container. 
 One ply toilet paper in room bathroom.  If you prefer better tp be prepared to bring some
