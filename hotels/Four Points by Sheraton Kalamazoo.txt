Four Points by Sheraton Kalamazoo
Rating: 4
Text: The rooms are beautiful and the beds are very comfortable. I didn't like that the room was a bit dusty. Also that there were a lack of towels in the bathroom. They have free breakfast. It includes waffles, egg omelette, bacon or sausage  (turkey option always seem limited) fruit, oatmeal, yogurt, potatoes, and cereal. They have a large seating area downstairs that also looks nice. It can get chilly with the door always opening and closing though. Overall I enjoyed my stay here.

Text: Great hotel in Kalamazoo. Great little restaurant /bar offering local craft beer and love music. Breakfast buffet everyday as well. The fitness center looked nice but I didn't get to try it. The rooms are comfortable and the staff was really friendly.

Text: Its wonderful! !! Beds are great as everyone talks about. My only complaint would be no trash bags in the trash bins but that just makes it hard on them.

Text: A perfectly fine hotel. No fridge in the room though. Depending on the room, you might hear a lot of noises. Basic fitness center.
