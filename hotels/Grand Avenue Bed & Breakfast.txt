Grand Avenue Bed & Breakfast

Text: This is our first experience at a B&B. HATE hotels, won't stay in one. Very familiar with Carthage, regular visitor. Wanted to treat husband to a special Father's Day, since he keeps asking me to slow down and stop. So, I did. This home is exceptional, the owners are exceptional. We just spent the evening Saturday and this morning and nothing negative can be said. We LOVED it, we plan on going back, ON A REGULAR basis, when time permits. Breakfast was delicious and wholesome and Jeannie is delightful. THE ROOM, was beyond expectations and we never feel comfortable anywhere but home. WE did here. VERY quite, cozy and CLEAN beyond imagination. And the plus is, if you love history like we do, especially Carthage history-- you will love it too. After all, I work in a museum, how could we go wrong? RIGHT? We didn't! Recommend to anyone.

Text: This is a WONDERFUL place to stay! The couple who own and run the bed and breakfast are very friendly and helpful. They keep the beautiful old house in grwat condition and very clean. They are eager and willing to provide for the needs of their guests. We stayed in the Mark Twain Suite, and absolutely loved it! The breakfast was delicious and they make sure to check for allergies before and when you arrive.  I would love to come back and stay again!

Text: It was 5 minutes away from where I needed to travel for work. The house is beautiful and the owners are very friendly and hospitable. In the evening,  I got to relax on the front porch in the rocking chair enjoying some tea. The Louisa May Alcott room was very lovely with some of the author's books to read which I also enjoyed. Before I checked out the next morning, I had a very good breakfast prepared by the owner. Perfectly presented at a beautiful table. I highly recommend this B&B!

Text: We enjoyed the stay here. Comfortable bed and sweet jacuzzi tub. Conveniently located on a main strip close to everything. House was neatly tastefully decorated with period pieces. Jeanie was super nice and helpful and a GREAT cook. She didn't bother us at all, but was there if we needed info about local stuff, etc. She asked if we had dietary restrictions and respected those. Never had that at a B&B before. I was thankful because I did have a few that she worked around. We would definitely stay here again.
