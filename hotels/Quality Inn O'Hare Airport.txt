Quality Inn O'Hare Airport

Text: This hotel is gross! The first room smelled so bag we asked to move. The next one wasn’t really better. Heard a couple in the room next to us at 3 am doing THINGS very loudly. Only good thing was the shuttle. We got to and from the airport rather quickly.

Text: You get what you pay for. The rooms were adequate. Neither great nor horrible. The bathroom didn't have a fan. The airport shuttle only runs every 30 mins. Almost didn't have a parking spot. The desk attendant was pretty disengaged. The breakfast was ok. Could have at least had some scrambled eggs and links. But for the price there was nothing lacking. 
The fire alarm did go off for about 15 minutes and none of the staff seemed to know what was going on. That was pretty annoying.

Text: This was my first time staying at this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was very convenient to get to from the airport. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was clean. Would definitely go back!

Text: I'm not sure where all these other people have been staying, the buildings smelt old and moldy. The pictures look nothing like this place either, unless you want the need to get a tetnis shot go some where else.
