Text: The stay was nice. The rooms are a good size and pretty comfy. The second floor hallway was freezing. Walking distance to a gas station and McDonald's and right near the highway. The lobby area is nice And the desk people are friendly for the most part.

Text: These rooms are great. It was so wonderful to be able to have both sleeping area and also sitting area, for our group when we were in town for a convention. Breakfast is generally the only meal we need to worry about when we are at conventions, not here the breakfast was amazing nothing to worry about, just go downstairs grab what you want and enjoy a nice solid breakfast.

Text: Any of the area's others hotels are a better short term option than this place. The a.c. was loud to the point where it shook our entire room. It sounded like a jake break on an eighteen wheeler was driving by at all times. 

You can hear every bit of movement from room above. This place was a dud and I hope to never stay at one again.

Text: Good, but not great. We arrived before check-in time and were told maater-of-factly that our room was not ready, despite that fact that I had requested an early check-in. Room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good, but not top notch among the hotel breakfasts we've experienced. Parking was convenient. The basketball court was kind of noisy on the Sunday morning we were there. An exterior room would avoid this.
