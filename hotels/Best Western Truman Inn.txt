Best Western Truman Inn

Text: Pleasantly surprised with the room and the breakfast service.  Staff was extremely helpful and attendant to any needs we had.  Property is a bit dated but appears to be being maintained quite well.  Expected issues with interstate noise as we were located just 4 rooms from busy I-70 and Noland Rd but the rooms were very quiet.  No problems with noise.

Text: We stayed here for a Chiefs & Broncos  game GM Brian and all his staff were wonderful. We especially enjoyed the 1st class treatment we got from Audrey from the minute we checked in to our last day there. We are glad we stayed with you. Also enjoyed the shuttle to and from the game....
Thank You Alfred Ritz

Text: Clean, comfortable room.  Comfortable beds.  Good hot & cold buffet breakfast (& free).  The staff was very friendly and efficient.  The room was a bit small, but still plenty of room.  Great price!

Text: Good place to stay for visits to Independence, MO or eastern KC.  Immediate access to Interstate yet found the rooms quiet.  This is an older hotel but rooms have been well updated.  Outside of hotel shows more signs of age.  Standard  BW breakfast and fitness center available.  Daily paper provided.

Text: Standard sized rooms, but they are well appointed. Happy to see 2 chairs so we didn't have to sit on the bed to watch TV. I'm not a fan of the doors opening directly to the outside, motel style. Very easy access to and from the highway.
