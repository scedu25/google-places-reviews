Americas Best Value Inn - Kansas City East / Independence

Text: We checked in around midnight. We lost everything we own in a fire and the staff were very friendly and understanding as to why some of us weren't wearing shoes. The rooms were clean. Cigarette burns in the blankets but they were at least clean. We had a full roll and a small bit of toilet paper in the bath room. We had to ask for more towels twice. The bed was insanely comfortable. I'm not sure if it was from the stress or what but we are really enjoying the stay. Would 100% recommend.

Text: Great basic hotel, clean and comfy with minor inconveniences that don't quite round it out. Tv was almost too blurred to watch, and bathroom light turned on maybe half the time instantly, flickering to life slowly the other times. Fridge excellently roomy and cold, microwave worked slowly but worked. Yet, for the price, would do it again a hundred times. Recommended.

Text: Its a old motel but its cheap so the rooms are clean your close to public trans monday -saturday no public trans on sunday the only thing i would say is the desk and desk chair is to large for the space in the room how i would up date the hotel is go room by room i would take every thing out and put the same bed in but i would put a differenr desk and chair in and dresser i would put new plugs in and usb plugs for cell phones i think people would like that a lot i would put new lights in every room and make them all led lights and the bath room and the sink i would remove the door and build more of a wall and and the sink and mirror in with bath tub and shower i do think that could be done and i would re paint the rooms and re paint the whole building so it looks like its a welcome place and i would put the frig and micwave on top of the dresser to save floor room and i would have 2 end tables on both side of the bed and for the breakfast for the price to stay here its great i would switch it up every day on what i serve to my guest  i would love to be come part of the hotel i think i could make it a lot better place to say i would charge for a night 75.00 with the price going up i could work with up grade in the rooms and i could get a better supply for breakfast and i would put different tvs in all rooms and its a great hotel just needs some one who will go from room to room and fix it up i think it would be a great hotel with up grades

the rooms was very dirty and smelled nasty and very out dated and  to large of desk and chair and ac/heater in room my ideal would be re paint the hotel rooms and new beding would help and lot and the fridge did not even keep my food cold so that was a huge issue i had to could not keep food staf was great the only other issue i had was the cleaning people did not speak english so when you tryed to talk with them they did not under stand at all there was lots of people smoke pot and doing drugs here and this hotel is a sex hotel and weed hotel i would re do the whole hotel

Text: We got their late, but they got us right into a room and it was clean. Very nice room for a reasonable rate. I recommend the Independence location anytime. Even 2:30 a.m. The bed was awesome too. King size for under $70? Awesome!
