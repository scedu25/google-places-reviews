Ivanhoe Estates Mobile Home Park

Text: The lot RENT is insanely high and going up another $50 next year! The owners are out of their damn minds! Moving asap! $415 to live here and only $250 to live in Mahomets candle wood estates. These people are crooks and trying to bleed their residents for every dime!

Text: I lived in this park for 26 years. I raised a son and enjoyed the location and attached park for walking/playing with my dog very much. The staff was always attentive and reasonable. I do not normally post things online like this but seeing some negative reviews made me think it would be worthwhile. 

Honestly when I was there the only residents that had issues with the management did not pay their rent or keep their yards clean. This is a nice place to live.
