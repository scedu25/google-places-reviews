Text: We booked online 2 weeks in advance. (Beware of the date when you book. We assumed dates would stay the same moving through the parent site and they did not). All hotels in the area were full for college graduation and conference track meets. Linda, the clerk at the Super 8 was fantastic! She worked hard to help find us a room, calling other places and trying to help. After a bit, she was able to move things around and place us in a room at the Super 8. We were very appreciative. Small town caring matters. 
Rooms are clean and updated. Lobby is cozy and staff friendly. Good bang for the buck.
