Courtyard by Marriott Springfield Downtown
Rating: 5
Text: Ideal for meetings.  I attended a weekend event.  The facility was beautiful and modern.  The floor layout of the common area accommodated the 250+ students that wanted to mingle and network.  The hotel provided delicious buffets that allowed us to dine in comfort and return to our sessions.

Text: Overall a great experience at this hotel. We stayed here for a wedding and were very pleased with our stay. After the weddeong several of us hung out at the bar and were treated with great service from the bartender. The rooms themselves are nice and up to date and I would definitely stay here again.

Text: Staff is friendly. Carpets are disgusting. Decor is good. Hotel bar is really goofy. Kind of feel like I'm in my parents basement, home "bar". Breakfast buffet is good. Springfield city is a horrible place to visit.

Text: Stayed one night for a wedding. I live in the city and one of the nicest hotels. Service is reasonable. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Conveniently located in the middle of the city where everything is within 5-10 min driving distance
