Text: Great place to park it. Beautifully kept. Great creek to stick your feet in during these dog days of summer. Appreciate that people keep their pets to themselves but also have a little doggie park right next to the kiddie park.

Text: Beautiful campground. Full hook up is always a plus. Grounds are kept up very well. Easy access to a neat Creek that the kids can splash and play in. It is also close to all of the Cape Girardeau attractions.
