Americas Best Value Inn & Suites

Text: I was very impressed with the room. The bathroom had a soap dispenser, and the shower had shampoo and body wash dispensers, something I've never encountered at a hotel. Loved the high ceilings, ceiling fans, and overhead lights. The television wires needed to be messed with before it would work. The pillows were heavenly. Only stayed one night and didn't try the breakfast. It was very compact, overall, but not claustrophobic.

Text: If I could give only half a star,I would. My family and I had to abandon our house a 12 o'clock at night and find a hotel. Our pipes burst and our house was flooded. The lady was very rude when we got there and  once we got in our room it was very dirty. The bathroom was gross and the ac was very loud and not working right. We expected to get rest after what happened to us and that was not the case. People yelling and hollering in the halls at all hours of the early morning and I was told they couldn't do anything.  After everything that happened to us we just wanted sleep and left very tired and angry. NEVER STAY HERE!
