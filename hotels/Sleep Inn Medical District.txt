Text: Great location. Even better customer service by young girl at front desk. Made me feel safe as a young female solo traveler and went above and beyond to help. Woman running breakfast was also kind and engaging. The hotel is nice and average but the customer service puts it over the top. Thank you!

Text: Location was great. The front desk staff was very friendly & helpful. The room was clean, had everything we needed, and had been recently renovated. Only two complaints, but I feel they're important ones. #1. The mattress was very hard. I normally like a fairly firm mattress, but this was way too hard. #2. King sized beds should have king sized pillows on them. The bed had about 6 small pillows. Its not as if they're the only hotel that does this, but I always make a positive mental note when I stay somewhere that actually puts king sized pillows on the bed.
