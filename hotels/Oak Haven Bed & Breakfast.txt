Text: Oak Haven Bed & Breakfast is the perfect getaway spot.  The home is gorgeous and the hospitality is wonderful!  The view is spectacular, and we loved hiking in the woods on the property.  We highly recommend it and can't wait to go back!

Text: This b&B should be called "Oak Heaven!"
It was a sunny spring weekend in artsy Nashville, IN, made even better by our two-night stay at Oak Haven Bed & Breakfast. Owner and hostess Sharon served us mouth-watering breakfasts – pancakes and to-die-for apple tarts accompanied by seasonal fruits, juices and homemade bakery. The B&B is tastefully furnished with vintage furniture, comfy beds and in-suite bathrooms yet includes enough modern conveniences (electronics and a whirlpool tub) to make a visit definitely 21st century. The very accommodating hostess made our visit pure pleasure. Quiet and peaceful, Oak Haven B&B is surrounded by 30 acres of woodland with hiking trails nearby and Brown County State Park just minutes away. Nashville boasts streets lined with shoppes offering a wide variety of artisan created arts, crafts and fashions and choices of many foods from burgers and brews to fine dining. It was the perfect location for our annual sisters’ get-away.

Text: My sisters, my best friend and I spent a beautiful fall weekend at Oak Haven and had the best time ever! It was my sisters' first experience at a B & B and they were hesitant at first. But I chose wisely and they loved every minute. The Inn is serenely tucked away in the woods so we could enjoy taking walks accompanied by the two kitties --- yet we were less than 10 minutes from the hustle and bustle of the shopping in downtown Nashville. Innkeeper Sharon was amazing, making sure we had everything we needed to make my sister's birthday a huge success. And the food? Well, we had no problem stuffing ourselves with wonderful sausages, eggs, fruit, and incredible baked delights! It was difficult to say goodbye, but we'll be back!
