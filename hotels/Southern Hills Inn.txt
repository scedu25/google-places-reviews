Text: This was the worst hotel I ever stepped foot in. There was holes in the walls, it was not clean and there was a spider the size of my finger by the light switch. The bathroom was disgusting, worst customer service. The women got an attitude with us because we told her it was unacceptable and her response was this is not a chain hotel. Regards the room should not look this way. There was water stains comin from the light switch, it was just disgusting. 0 stars but it won’t let me post without giving them 1!!!!

Text: I would really like to speak on the Country Hearth because we had a sweet but the owner said since we had 5 people we would have to rent 2 rooms because of fire code.Now Southern Hills we rented a room for 2 weeks.While we were settling in I seen a bed bug ,I immediately found a plastic bag and put the BUG in it I then began to repack what I had already packed in plastic bags and sealed them so I could run the clothes thru the dryer.As I was putting the bag outside the room the owner came by and asked what was going on I explained I found a bed bug and gave him the plastic bag with the bug in it ,he examined it and said he had just had the " bug Guy " there 3 days prior but he would refund us our money which he did without any problem.The owner or what I presumed to b the owner was extremely helpful ,nice and considerate.I was very pleased with the service the only problem was the bug ,which happens .It wasn't an infestation and I only seen 3 all together 2 young adults and 1 adolescent .

Text: The woman employee charged me a price for a single room and when I went to extend my stay, the male manager tried to charge me $30 more for the same room. He was very rude and disrespectful. I will never stay there again!
