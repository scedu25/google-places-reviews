M-Star Hotel Mansfield
Rating: 4
Text: Very clean hotel. New carpet and paint.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because bathroom is a little out dated and only a stand up shower but bathroom itself is very clean as well. I will be staying a few weeks for work but would recommend just for one night stays as well. This was a non smoking room. I was told smoking rooms werent as nice.

Text: Very nice for the price! I've stayed in hotels that cost over 100 a night and been less satisfied with the rooms. It's not the Ritz but if you need a place to crash it can't be beat

Text: The room was really nice, I'll give the place that. Definitely dated, but well cared for and recently updated. However, there were a few incidents that drove my opinion down. First, the man staffing the front desk was also working in the convenience store attached, which meant check-in took a long time. Second, the coffee machine hadn't been cleaned. And third, which sealed the deal for me, was the screaming outside at 10p which led to the cops arriving. I would have come back based on the room quality, but the incident with the police made me feel super unsafe.
Also, the walls are super thin, so keep that in mind.

Text: Clean and affordable. Bathroom could use updating, but besides that it was exactly what you expect for the money.

Text: It's ok for what it is but I would rather stay at the Holiday Inn across the street.
