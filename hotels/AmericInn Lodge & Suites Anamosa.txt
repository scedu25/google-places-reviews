AmericInn Lodge & Suites Anamosa
Rating: 4
Text: The environment was pleasant as it always is at this chain. Our stay had issues of under staffed and a room issue. The staff did their best to remedy the situation. Will be back but will check rooms thoroughly before totally unpacking. Our travel companions had no problems with their room and were very happy. Breakfast was very good. Clean well attended to breakfast. Pool and hot tub were nice and clean too.

Text: I can't imagine you can find a cleaner, more pleasant place to stay, even at a higher price. Staff was first rate, treat you exactly like you want to be treated! The lobby, the breakfast/bar area and especially the room were spotless. I asked if the facility was brand new, and was told that it opened in about 2009-I was amazed! If you go to Anamosa to visit the motorcycle museum, this is the place to stay. One exit away and AmericInn even gave me a coupon for a buck off the museum entrance fee. I highly recommend it.
