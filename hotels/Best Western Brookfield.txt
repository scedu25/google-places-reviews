Text: Excellent hotel in a small town. Quick check in and check out. Room was clean. Air conditioning nice and cool. Breakfast was typical fare, but fresh eggs and sausage and biscuits. Will stay again.

Text: Everything in the facility was clean and in its place.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  The room was very nicely done and super clean.  Breakfast was delicious and kept stocked.  I slept well and felt right at home.  It was everything an innkeeper should be.

It is also located near a Wal-Mart so that was very handy.
