BLUE RV Park
Rating: 1
Text: friendly dude parked us and gave us a couple of back in sights to park crossways for a couple of nights.  Dogs run loose and seemed to like our spot to do their business, but the caretaker did let me borrow his rake to clean the site, but then next day, fresh load, guess they think with cow lots and packing plant within 1/2 mile no one would mind.  Think the 2.5 is generous average rating.

Text: Small sites, a lot of campers jammed into a small area. Immediately adjacent to the old commercial end of Dodge City. Enjoy the smell of the beef plant while you are there.

Text: A bit hard to find if following Google Maps. It's directly across from Roto-Mix (about half mile east of the location marker). Owner is nice, simple sites with full hookups, laundry and restrooms/showers. Free wifi available but often not working. Great for a short stop and passing through.
