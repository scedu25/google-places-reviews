Text: place is right(well two rights lol)  off the highway and clean. the staff is very friendly and the place is fairly quiet. reasonably priced(looks like they raised the prices for campers based off electrical hookup needs).  Showers and restrooms are clean, im not picky, just happy the water was hot. 

Firewood was brought to our campsite, that was so unexpected and nice.

Text: Our first experience with this campground was great so good we decided to book another trip while there.  We decided to book a cabin, after quickly realizing the cabin we booked was or what we expected we want to cancel the reservation nearly a month in advance, so we did or at least the told us verbally we did.  We never recovered a cancellation confirmation and called numerous times to verify this reservation was cancelled. After a visit in person twice and being reassure we would be credited the amount for the reservation back we were not.  This place is diseatful and untrustworthy, I would NOT recommend this campground to anyone.

Text: I would suggest this Campground to everyone planning a visit there, it's right off exit 33 and easy to reach.  The Campground is clean with well maintained bathrooms.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  We had an amazing two days there.  It's close to the gas station and subway  and just a few minutes from all the trails.
