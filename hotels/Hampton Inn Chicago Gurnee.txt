Hampton Inn Chicago/Gurnee
Rating: 5
Text: I stayed at the Hampton Inn Chicago/Gurnee for two nights, and I was delighted by the service. Check in and check out was swift and courteous, and the lobby and room felt welcoming. The complimentary breakfast at 7am, all-hours coffee station, and fresh cookies at 8pm were greatly appreciated. The location is within walking distance of several restaurants, as well as Six Flags Great America. Overall, my experience was pleasant and I will be visiting there again.
