Text: I had room 10. Very nice for one person  was extremely clean and fresh. Frank is a wonderful host and is very concerned about your satisfaction. When I stay in ft Scott again it will be with my wife and of course I will ask for a king suite which is also beautiful. I can't say enough nice things about frank and his wife. They are the best.
