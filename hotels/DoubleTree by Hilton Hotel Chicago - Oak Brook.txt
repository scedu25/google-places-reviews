DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago - Oak Brook
Rating: 4
Text: This hotel was very nice and clean. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub. And the breakfast at the Atrium was delicious! The only thing I wished was that there was a full service Starbucks inside. I really missed my morning drink.

Text: Stayed in a king sized room. Room size was adequate. TV could have been bigger (32 inches). Cleaning crew is good. Bathroom is excellent. Shower has a circular curtain holder giving the illusion of a bigger tub. Breakfast has a solid selection as well. The hotel is in close proximity to shopping malls and areas to grab some food. The hotel is also about 30 minutes out from downtown Chicago. Would recommend.

Text: Rooms are just OK. Bathrooms are cramped. Beds are comfortable. There is a bar with good food and a small convience store.  They had breakfast in the morning but there was a convention being held and so many people there that they had a wait to get a table so I skipped that. There are other nicer Hilton hotels close by so I will continue to stay in one of those in future trips.

Text: Service was great, food was delicious, staff was the best and friendliest I've encountered in a hotel. But 5th floor has bed bugs. Would never go back because of this.
