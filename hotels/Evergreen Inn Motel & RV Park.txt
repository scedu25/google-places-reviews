Evergreen Inn Motel & RV Park
Rating: 4
Text: We use this spot as a roadside RV park when we are traveling to the American Southwest.  Good and cheap, with fairly level spots.  Although narrow, they make for a fine overnight stay.  Rick's restaurant is next door, and they have a good solid Americana menu with good service.  Full hook-ups are great, and it is easy to get in and out.  All gravel.  Nothing fancy, but wonderful for $30/night.

Text: Conveniently located right off US 54, the Inn is small, had a nice park-like area and a nice looking swimming pool. It was only 45 degrees the day we stayed, so we didn't swim. We got an RV sure with FHU/30 amps for $30 a night. The site was narrow, but adequate, fairly level. To us it's a good overnight stop. Nice people in the office.

Text: Very narrow spots. No picnic table with spot. Space just wide enough for van and trailer. Thankful no one on either side of us. Bathrooms were nice. Pool was heated kids played in pool until dark. Level spot.
