Cleveland Airport Marriott
Rating: 3
Text: Too expensive for the experience. I checked "Go green" during my mobile check-in to skip housekeeping, and it didn't register for them. When purchasing, the option was a king bed or two full beds, but they never asked which of the two I wanted and gave me, a single guest, 2 beds. The "handle", if you can call it that, on the bathroom door was barely a small notch that was hard to grasp. There is a Denny's right next door if you want a quick bite. I don't recommend eating at the AMP restaurant in the hotel. One redeeming feature though, was the great and friendly service of the employees.

Text: The location is right off the highway. There aren't many places to eat around outside of the AMP 150 located in the hotel. The food there is good. The staff is very friendly. Rooms are great.

Text: I absolutely enjoyed my stay at the Cleveland Airport Marriott. It is a very modern and upscale Hotel. The hotel has a in-house amazing restaurant. My one only slight negative was I had issues checking in as I used a hotel service provider for my room. There was a little confusion at the front desk that was quickly resolved

Text: For the price I paid for a last minute room, I was over-the-moon happy with the staff/service here.  Everyone was nice and extremely accommodating.  Rooms are pleasant and have been redone in the past few years.  Will stay here again if I find myself in Cleveland.

Text: We went for a wedding reception. Also sat at the lobby bar. Bar service in the lobby and for the event was spectacular. Very friendly employees, quick and efficient service. Food at the event wasnt the best, but wasn't the worse. The facility was updated and clean.
