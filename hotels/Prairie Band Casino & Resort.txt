Prairie Band Casino & Resort

Text: The RV park is behind the casino and you use the last driveway to get to it. The roads in are easy to navigate and check in was fast and friendly. They have over 50 sites and do not take reservations. We were in site 40, cement and very level with a wider than normal strip of grass and a picnic table. We had full hook ups, 50 amp and good water pressure. Nothing out of the ordinary with the hook ups. Park is well maintained and the bath house and laundry room were exceptionally clean. They offer a shuttle service to the casino plus it is an easy walk back and forth. We stayed one night, June 23, 2017 and paid $26.50 after a $5.00 discount when we got a Players Card at no cost.

Text: Stayed here when playing their resort golf course Firekeeper. The course was amazing and the hotel, restaurants (three fires was very very good try a ribeye), and casino were well kept and a nice place to spend some time with friends. The hotel, food, and golf was very reasonably priced. I will go back!

Text: My rating is influenced by the facility design, more than the operation. Was here for an overnight conference. No desk in my room to do any work, just 2 chairs and a low table. Room was clean, decor was nice. 2 of my friends complained that their rooms smelled like smoke. I didn't notice it in mine. The only bar we found was actually in the casino, not a separate space. Slot machine noise in background made conversation nearly impossible. Conference facility was nice. Support staff was well trained.
