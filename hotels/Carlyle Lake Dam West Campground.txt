Text: Fantastic camping & RV park. Big sites and most are paved.  Several sites are available to be reserved and are sought after (sites 55 - 50 but might be big rig cation areas due to low hanging tree limbs).  Big rig friendly.  Several full hook up sites (75-97). All sites have 50 amp service. Well maintained with many sites along the water's edge. Quiet and family friendly. Wal-Mart just a couple of miles away (no fuel station though). Lots of bike trails, beach for swimming and fishing spots. This is a little Gem and we'll stay here every time we come through the area.

Text: The campground and lake were wonderful, however the staff running the campground....not so much. The older woman working in the little office to the entrance to the campground is terrible, I will never camp here again just because of her. Do not work in the public if you do not have any customer service skills, people who are trying to enjoy themselves do not want to deal with someone as snippy and rude as this woman.

Text: Nice sites, great private bathroom and shower, close to Walmart and everything Carlyle offers. Well behaved, considerate campers in general. Can't think of any negatives. Great price. Don't tell anyone.
