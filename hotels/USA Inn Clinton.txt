Text: Not worth give money. Can stay at a nicer motel with indoor pool and better amenities for the same amount of money.         Vv

Text: The price was fair,  the room was very clean, the bed was more comfortable than other places I have stayed,  and the woman at the front desk was very nice even when I booked and checked in at almost midnight. I think it is a fine little motel.

Text: Not at all impressed, hotels down the road we're booked which is what led me here.  Extremely overpriced, card was charged and received receipt at time of check in. Was met by a barefoot receptionist which leaves an unprofessional first impression.  Shower was absolutely horrendous. This is one place where I was actually afraid to walk without shoes or socks. Seen the sign for breakfast and also online, turned out to be honey buns, and cereal. Suggest you keep driving. Much better hotels exist for the same price. Sometimes you don't actually get what you pay for.

Text: Room was ok. Biggest issue was the room said non smoking but it had most definitely been smoked in.
