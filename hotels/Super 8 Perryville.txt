Super 8 Perryville

Text: I stayed here for two  and all half  weeks and I was very satisfied the whole time. The room was very clean, whenever I had a question or needed something I was helped right away. Staff  at the entrance desk and housekeepers were very friendly. Whenever I get  in this area again for sure I would stay  here again.

Text: Very friendly staff. Clean room. Great location. Staff was helpful when I asked questions.

The only issue was a lack of selection at breakfast. The hostess at breakfast was also very friendly.

Text: The pool and hot tub were small but still nice!  The room was good, but the beds are a little hard.  Loved the fact that the bed had 6 pillows!  The breakfast was a little disappointing.  The staff was nice.

Text: We reserved a non-smoking room as we have members who have very bad allergies to smoke. Our guest room was sprinkled with non-smoking room signs, however, the stench from opening the door, our clothing, luggage and lungs and allergies knew otherwise. After we checked out and left the room we still felt the ill effects of the smoke filled room for hundreds of miles and hours later down the road. It was unfortunate that the motel did not have any other rooms available and we were committed to staying there for the night as there were not any other rooms available. Very dissatisfied and should have requested a refund for booking a non-smoking and receiving quite the opposite. Clean air matters more if you are medically allergic to smoke.  Super Sad Super 8 in Perryville, MO.

Text: I would put 5 stars for the staff. The rooms are very comfy.  The breakfast is lacking in good protein.
