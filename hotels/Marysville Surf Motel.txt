Text: Decent room, better than average breakfast, friendly service, convenient location (if you're driving US 36).  Also the meal at the bowling alley next door was a unexpected bonus.

Text: The rooms were fairly standard. Fairly updated (flat screen TV, refrigerator, etc.) Breakfast was included. It was kind of disappointing. Overall, it was pretty standard. Nothing to write home about, but not horrible. It did the job for the night.
