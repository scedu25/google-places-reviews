Fiedlerland RV park & campgrounds
Rating: 4
Text: Still a diamond in the ruff but rapidly approaching 5 stars. Genuine friendship and hospitality abound at this camp site. Great for RVs looking for hookups  and perfect for camping bikers looking for an accommodating base to jettison the trailer or camping gear for a few days while exploring the many natural and historical wonders offered within easy riding distances.  
The roads and scenery in the area are amazing and this is the best place to rest weary bones whether you’re just passing through for one night or making it a destination for one of the many special events held at the campground or nearby.
