Text: We stay here every year, usually twice a year. Bruce and Debbie are great. The rooms are always clean and the staff is friendly. We bring our 2 small dogs with us.

Text: My family and I stayed at the Bunk house for one night on our way to Branson. It is an adorable mom and pop place with a cute western theme. The owners were friendly and helpful. And didn't even charge us full price when it was actually my screw up. Not that it is expensive it was only $57 to stay one night. Rates don't change on the weekends either. We had a very comfortable clean room. Microwave, coffee pot and mini fridge in our room. I was very shocked of the price considering what you got for it. They also have a nice pool. And a gift shop with tons of neat stuff in it. The only thing that I can say negative is they don't have  breakfast. But even that wasnt that big of a deal considering what you do get for the price. We went and had a sit down breakfast for my family of 5 and still paid less for breakfast and room than if we were to go to a a different Hotel. Sorry for review being so long but I have never written one before and didn't want to miss anything. But we will def be staying there everytime we come to see our parents in Warsaw. Or any time we are in this part of Mo. In fact on our way back through from this trip as well.

Text: My family and I were in Lincoln because our father was very ill. We had to fly in from out of state on short notice and needed a room. The owners were wonderful to us. We loved the rooms. They were decorated so nice. The place is clean and reasonably priced. If you ever have to stay in Lincoln Missouri, this is the place to stay.

Text: The owners were nice but the entrance and office area was dark and hot. Our room was clean but we fought the flies constantly. The laundry room was dirty as was the outdoor pool. We had to clean the pool ourselves before we could swim in it. They need help in taking care of their lodge.
