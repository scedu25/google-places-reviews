Text: Came for the eclipse and the proprietors couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. A great Jam session put on the night before, hay ride to and from Homestead...

To make it even better, prices weren't inflated. I talked to a few other people there who would have paid more. Thanks for the great time. Would recommend Oak Aven and Beatrice NE to anyone.
