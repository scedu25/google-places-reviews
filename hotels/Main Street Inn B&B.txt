Text: It oozes with charm from the moment you enter.   Beautiful parlors to sit and read the newspaper or enjoy a cup of coffee or tea.     Large, airy, quiet rooms with beautiful reminders of days gone by and the history we only read about.  Many little touches that make you feel special.  The Innkeepers, Ken and Karen, were awesome hosts.  Extremely friendly and I loved how they sat with us and talked about the history of the town and how they came to be in Ste.
