Steve Alford All American Inn
Rating: 5
Text: This place was great. Misty checked me in—friendly as could be—and the whole inn is decorated in a fun way, with trophies, jerseys, and other basketball memorabilia. It was very affordable, the bed was very comfortable after 14 hours behind the wheel, and it was nice and clean. I would definitely stay again.

Text: Staff were super friendly and helped fix the problem. Unfortunately our original rooms air conditioner was busted and it was 82 degrees. When this was mentioned to staff she was very apologetic, and switched our room. She mentioned that this is a known issue of rm 201, which makes me think management doesn't care. The room we were switched to was a two bed room, so that wasn't pleasent for my husband and I. Overall the hotel was just so so... for the price it was acceptable.

Text: We were given room 201 which had air conditioning problems, we left for the night but when we got back the air conditioner wasn't even working anymore and when I gave the staff the error message she immediately knew which room it was and said they kept putting people in that room even though it has problems. They unfortunately didn't have any rooms left with a king so my wife and I had to sleep in separate beds which were not very comfortable and pretty firm.
