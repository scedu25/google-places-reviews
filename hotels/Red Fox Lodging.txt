Red Fox Lodging

Text: My family booked several cabins and we had a great time! The cabins are nice and the location is peaceful. However, one of the cabins did have a mouse and the Red Fox Lodging staff didn't think it was a big deal. The remark was "What do you expect me to do about it?". Eventually (2 hours later) they sent someone to clean the mouse droppings (but the mouse was still seen in the cabin). I expected the staff to apologize and either offer us a new cabin or provide us with a discount.
