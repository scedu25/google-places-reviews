James Madison Inn
Rating: 1
Text: Disappointing is exactly what this place is. The people who run the inn are very disrespectful. Entered room without notice, moved belongings, turned air off and tried to kick me out due to some hair dye from a friend left in the sink, that was cleaned up. Judgemental humans who need to learn how to run a business and respect occupants privacy and rights. One of the worst motels/hotels I have stayed inn.

Text: Always a clean room, bathroom included. Everything works. Sweet couple that manages the Inn. No breakfast but I don't care. McDonaldS is around the corner. Price of this Inn is great.
