Text: I and my husband were staying here and it was a last resort due to a financial situation.  The place was nasty,  the ppl were rude as ever,  disrespectful and very nasty.  They have no morals,  and they lack common courtesy. They kicked my husband and I out AFTER WE PAID 150$ FOR A FULL WEEK and refused to give our money back which left us again,  homeless.  These ppl have no idea of what it means to actually keep a room CLEAN due to the fact that when we checked in the tub had a ring around it,  didn't drain,  the sink was brown and green like it hadn't been used in years.  And when I left a note for house keeping before leaving to Stay out of our room,  my husband and I came back to house keeping botching a fit that they were "offended" by my note....  I laughed because the only kinda ppl this place ever hires are drug addicts and ppl who steal when they "clean" ur room.  DO NOT STAY HERE! Heard from a friend staying there NOW,  at this very time,  he just found like 8 bed bugs in his room.  It wouldn't surprise me

Text: Absolutely disgusting sheets were dirty room was dirty and very rude. We couldn't even stay there because of the nastiness.  They charged us anyway and are refusing to give us our money back.  They called the cops on another part of our group that paid cash and went to their room and saw how filthy it was and said they can't stay there they refused to pay them back or let them cancel the next day's room.  They then called the cops and screamed derogatory comments about him and told him he would take him outside.  Don't stay in this hotel don't try your luck.... I think the good comments they have on here have got to be from their families or something. Terrible terrible place!!!
