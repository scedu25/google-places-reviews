Turner Katy Trail Shelter
Rating: 5
Text: A rustic slightly rugged place to stay overnight for people using the Katy Trail. Lots of bunk beds for large groups. The small kitchen area has a microwave, toaster oven, fridge, and coffee pot. There is a small bicycle repair area, two showers and a separate bathroom. It's a very good deal for only $5 a person.

Text: at first, it is a treasure to stay at. it has a/c, showers, and there was some leftover summer sausage and cheese to eat! but this place is INFESTED with bedbugs. There is no other explanation for it. i woke up with at least 15 bites all over my back and hips. the night before, when we camped, i had none. 

this place is a great concept, but definitely needs a deep cleaning.

Text: Stayed there 4 years in a row in October. Its been a convenient place to stay and you can't beat the price. Take your own blanket, pillow, and food (cause there isn't much around). We call it the Tebbits Bunk House.

Text: Great place!  Stopped on a cross-country ride.  There are showers, a stove and even a stock of food.  There is a restaurant next door, but don't get there too late.
