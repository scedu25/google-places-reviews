Text: Motel 6 was nicer. Heat didn't work here and shower backed up and was absolutely unacceptable and disgusting. Dust everywhere....and just overall dirty. If your staying for a night fine..I stayed for a week and found it a disgusting waste of money. The 2 stars are for the free laundry and polite service desk. Motel 6 is 100 dollars cheaper and just as nice if not better.

Text: My husband and I stayed last night as we were in town for my sons BCT Graduation. I booked our room 2 months ago. I can't say enough good things. The staff was amazingly friendly. Even though we booked a smoking room I had to question whether or not they gave us the wrong room. The only thing I felt needed work was the room door was a little difficult to open. I would recommend this spot to any of my friends AND we had a beautiful view of the sun set. Thank you Liberty Lodge and staff for a very welcoming visit.

Text: Definitely a 2 star hotel. Dirty and musty but honestly a good night sleep. Air conditioner was loud but worked great.I wouldn't pay over $40 for a room though. I was only there one night. Front desk staff were very nice.

Text: Paid $53, tax included, for a room with two beds, clean sheets, hot water, and comfortable A/C. Buffalo Wild Wings is walking distance even for the laziest person with a 15% discount on your entire order if you present your room card. The highway is loud but if you put your blanket over your head you'll be fine. Great price for the traveling student. Really thankful to stay at a place that's not trying to take all my money.
