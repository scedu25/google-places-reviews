Text: We had heard about Nate's talent in the kitchen but WOW!!!! Everything the four of us had was magnificent (four different menu items). The Hollandaise sauce is made from scratch, the pancakes hot, light and fluffy, the sausage was very flavorful. Our service was outstanding. All in Ft. Scott, KS. We would highly recommend.

Text: Possibly the worst restaurant I've ever dined at. We had breakfast. The scrambled eggs were watery, the waffle was a small wedge uncuttable with a  fork, no butter, v8 juice was warm, and the biscuits finally arrived after the meal was done, and then there was only one to split between two people! Hardly anyone there so it's not like they were swamped. No offer of coffee refill. Plus, we paid $23.00 for this disaster! First time in my life I've not left a tip. Don't waste your time and certainly not your money. Two thumbs down.
