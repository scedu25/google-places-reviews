Motel 6 St. Louis - Bridgeton Mo

Text: It was a nice clean place. The customer service was great. Stephanie at the front desk was cheerful as we walked in and provided us with a room to stay in. A few problems are that they don't have a microwave, Coffee Maker, Refrigerator or Laundry. Basically this motel is just a clean room to sleep with a high price. If you want to pay the same price and have more amenities, I suggest you try Super 8 across the street.

Text: Briana was simply amazing!! We left home in Iowa when I got home from work at 6am. My husband called to see if there were any vacant rooms from the previous night and there were two. We asked Briana if it would be possible to check in around 11 am into one of the rooms that was available she assigned us a room and assured us it would be waiting for us when we got there and sure enough it was!! We were only there for the night to celebrate my husbands birthday, but had so much stuff planned for the day, including the game, so being able to check in early and unpack our stuff was greatly appreciated. 

Our room looked like it was very well kept. My husband and I used to work in the hotel business, so we always tend to do a through inspection of our room when we arrive. The floors were clean, beds were made nicely, bathroom was clean. I only had two complaints the first being the location of the bathroom light switch, which weirdly was not located in the bathroom and the other was that one of the bedspreads had burn marks on. Granted, we only used one of the beds so it really wasn't that big of a deal. 

Every employee we encountered was very nice. We are already planning a trip back to St. Louis for next year with our kids and based on our experience at this property, we will most likely stay when we return.

Text: I have stayed at motel 6 for the past 3 weeks off and on. I love the new decor. I feel safe. BUT  I have noticed that the staff aren't cleaning with the least bit of noticeable, obvious things.....under the bed the bath tub, the vents. Your prices could be cheaper. The taxes makes it a bit too much. A10, 15$ cut would be nice. Over all I would still stay again. Any more nastier I will have to take my business else where.

Text: I was very happy with my stay. The room was clean, the lady at the front desk was very helpful, friendly and smiled the whole time. The manager was very polite as well.  I don't want to pay $150 just to sleep overnight. I only stay in Motel 6 and would recommend it to anybody who's looking for a comfortable and affordable stay

Text: Needed to check in early, Briana at the front desk was awesome. I called talked to her and she was able to save us a room for a few hours until we got there, great customer service. Room was nice and clean, air worked well. Rooms looked updated and presentable.  Our only complaint would be one of the comforters had a burn hole in it.
