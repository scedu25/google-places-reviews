Laurel Brooke Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We stayed here a couple years ago. It was a very relaxing location in the country! The room was very comfortable and clean! I thought the experience was unique with the B&B being a renovated barn! The owner was very nice and the food was delicious! We had cider and pastries upon arrival. We also enjoyed watching a movie on the TV in the living room.
