Ironworks Hotel
Rating: 5
Text: Accommodations are comfortable--plush even. It feels like a home away from home. The ambience is industrial and modern, yet cozy. The staff are friendly and helpful. Amenities are plentiful and in-room snacks/drinks are fairly priced. The in-room fireplace and rub were the highlights of the comforts and well worth a stay. The hotel is a short walk from downtown Beloit, making it easy to grab some outside food or treats. The river is adjacent to the hotel and offers a calm, serene place to take a walk.

Text: We loved this hotel & it's decorations. When we booked we didn't realize there was a river view or we would have asked for that.  The fireplace that can be seen from tub is a great feature.  The only downfall is the banquet hall was directly under our room & they were having a wedding that was quite noisy. By about 11pm the wedding was over, but the restaurant (also downstairs) was just getting started.  If you have small children who need to get to bed early ask for a room farther upstairs to avoid the noise or just  don't stay here on the weekend.

Text: Fantastic hotel in a quaint downtown area. The rooms are wonderfully furnished and the rain showerheads in the lavish bathrooms are great. Highly recommended!
