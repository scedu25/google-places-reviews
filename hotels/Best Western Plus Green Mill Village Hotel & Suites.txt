Best Western Plus Green Mill Village Hotel & Suites
Rating: 5
Text: We love staying at this Best Western. It has such a nice atmosphere. I was happily surprised at the allergy friendly breakfast items. Almond milk, regular eggs ( not powdered ). Also gluten free items.  It was great to be able to eat a nice breakfast like everyone else. Those little details make a huge difference. Great service at front desk too. The carpet as you exit the elevator on 3rd floor could use some cleaning and the mattress was on the overly soft side. Not good for a bad back. Overall a great place to stay.

Text: We have stayed in the Green Mill Best Western several times now. It is always clean and the employees are friendly and helpful. We will stay here again next year when we come to the area.

Text: Very pleasant stay! We are picky travelers, but don't want to spend a lot of money for a road trip overnight stay. This place is just off the freeway, very safe, close to typical fast food and gas station. Has a small pool (that we didn't know about so didn't have time to use), very spacious rooms that are clean. No smoking or pets which is a plus for us as our child is allergic to dander. Beds are a little soft for my taste but I woke up rested and not sore. Beautiful hotel, felt like we were paying more than we did which is always great. Overall we were comfortable and not stressed and our small children were in great spirits and slept well. (when mommy and daddy are happy, kids are happy!) Icing on the cake is they have a FANTASTIC breakfast! Was able to find allergy friendly items for my little guy and he actually ate! We hope our ovenight stop lands here next time we travel!!

Text: Pet Friendly rooms need more attention, along with cleaning of carpets and bathrooms along with bedspreads replaced after each stay with dogs. Need to offer pet friendly suites so you have more room and can be comfortable.
