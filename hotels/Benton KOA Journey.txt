Benton KOA Journey
Rating: 5
Text: Good, gravel sites in the woods and hills. Well-maintained with facilities for families, pets, and children. Right alongside the interstate so noisy outside your camper. Lots of overnight campers so make reservations ahead. In/out is OK, if a little tight in spots. We got our 43' 5th-wheel in and out without incident, and would stay again without hesitation. Staff were very helpful and accommodating.

Text: Very nice campground.  Large sites with level pads.  Our site overlooked the catch and release pond with a swing on site to relax in.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  They guided us into our back in site in one shot and were awesome with knowing proper hand signals to direct you.  We liked the campground so well we decided to stay an extra day and the staff was very accommodating so we could keep the same site.  They were also very helpful in getting us the right light bulbs for our camper.  Would definitely stay here again.  Only negative was that the wifi kept kicking in and out.

Text: Awesome and affordable. Kabins have TV, fridge and microwave! Very helpful and friendly staff. Even when I arrived very late someone came out to direct me to my reserved site

Text: Nice spot, level site. Had a little scavenger hunt for kids and a prize if you finish. Site was next to pond. Was nice. Lots of bugs at night though but us expected. No issues with my stay.

Text: Great little camp ground. Smaller pool but the bathrooms are decent and so are the showers. They have a nice playground and tether ball.
