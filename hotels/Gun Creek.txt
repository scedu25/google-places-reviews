Text: This is a beautiful campground, but it has some serious flaws.  First of all, we arrived at our reserved spot mid afternoon and immediately realized it was going to be challenging to set up.  The slope on our lot (#29) and both adjacent lots were so severe that we could not get our 35 ft. fifth wheel level.  There was no indication online that these sites were so steep.  Our friends were in the site next to us and were finally able to level their shorter fifth wheel using wood blocks and some large stone blocks.  Another couple stopped to chat and indicated their site was also so steep that to get their motor home halfway level, both wheels were off the ground.  

The park ranger came by during the 1.5 hours it took for us to determine the site was not going to work, and he did not even check with us to see if we were having issues.  This was despite him admonishing the man at the site next to ours for not pulling far enough off the road and then inspecting our friends' site on the other side of us.  My husband went to the check-in booth to see if we could move to another more level site, ando he was told none were available.  At that point, we had no choice but to move to another campground. 

By the time we got packed up and left for the Whittington Woods campground down the road, the check in booth at the entrance to the campground was closed.  Once we were settled at our new and much more level campsite, my husband returned to remove the reserved card from our site.  Since it was the weekend and our site had been reserved for 9 nights, we felt it was the right thing to do knowing the campground was full.  But upon communicating with the campground once they opened the next day, we were admonished for removing it.  We were also told that we would have to pay for the previous night even though another camper was able to rent the site.  

My husband did go to the headquarters the following week to express our concerns, and we were told we would receive a full refund, including for the first night.  However, please be aware that several sites in this campground are very steep, especially for longer rigs.  If you are reserving, you may want to call and find out which sites are the more level ones.  I think these are often reserved first by the locals/frequent visitors.
