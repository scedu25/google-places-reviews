Text: The hotel staff was very accommodating.  Don't sleep on the side with the highway, which is the "odd numbered" side as you will listen to the cars and trucks all night!  The place is clean and the breakfast was very nice.

Text: The room was very nice. My kids loved having an indoor pool, which had pool toys. The staff was so nice. When they found out that we were in town for a funeral they sent gift baskets to the whole family.
