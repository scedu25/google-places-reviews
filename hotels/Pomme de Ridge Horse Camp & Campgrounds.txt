Text: Had a great time with the kids! The owner and her employee were wonderful; very friendly and helpful. They accommodated our requests for our special needs son and the cabin was lovely. The trails were a lot of fun, they let the kids play in their sprinkler and the view of the stars was absolutely amazing. Can't wait to go back! Truly a great find close enough to get away from town.
