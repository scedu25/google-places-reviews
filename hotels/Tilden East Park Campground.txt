Tilden East Park Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice town close to the highway but overall not too bad and a nice little shower house
Rating: 3
Text: We wanted to stay in Tilden so we camped here. Water and electric hook ups and a bathroom with shower that is being finalized. The drawback is the road noise - it's right next to 275.
