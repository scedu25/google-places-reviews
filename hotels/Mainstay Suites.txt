Mainstay Suites

Text: The room is great size and the chicken fully equipped but the strong smell from the corridor is so contagious that you smell it from inside your room too. 1st floor is a mess, front door used as storage place, laundry room on the way to the elevator. But the worst is having to ask for an extra key everyday since the key never works. For two days in a row, the different four keys they gave me didn't work, until someone went up with the master key to let me get inside my room. Quietly frustrating. Breakfast is very limited with no fruits at all.

Text: Good rate for a suite type room and has a kitchenette. The breakfast in the lobby was actually better than I expected. We did have an issue with trying to change the reservation (in order to remove a night we had to cancel reservation as a whole) on one of our rooms due to the fact they over booked their rooms, but finally did get it resolved after talking with owner. I would have rated 5 stars if this issue hadn't presented itself.

Text: Clean, affordable and great location. The first time i stayed it was great. This time im not to impressed. Pool is freezing and I let them know a couple times to please turn on the heater. I still have yet to be able to use it. I also was charged twice. Rooms are clean and upgraded though.
