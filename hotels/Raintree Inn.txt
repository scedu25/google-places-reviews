Text: Very rude ladies at front desk. Guess our business isn't needed. Stand around waiting for someone to talk to for hours,....  room is what I expected for an old hotel. Plastic bag over smoke detector ( not sure what that is supposed to do)..  asked for extra pillow was informed they didn't have extra pillows, asked for extra towel, was informed guest previous week ran off with 40 towels, so no extra towel, what kind of idiot gives a guest 40 towels??   So far the people I've met could take some etiquette courses.... at the very least they could b more excited to sell a room for two nights in this dump....

Text: Was good for two days but just yesterday me and my friend was robbed there had to be someone who works there since you need a card to get in and I had both while we was gone, cops where called. I will never go back and would hope no one else would or if you want your stuff stolen from you. I would recommend go to the Steve Alford all-American Inn they are very nice to you and the rooms are really nice and don't smell and the tv has a lot of good stations.

Text: Maybe  70 bucks to some people to lay your head down is not much or
maybe some don't care. I had a reserved room only to find after driving all day they couldn't find it. They apologize for the inconvenience due to training new people and renovations being done. Trying to be patient was growing thin. My key cards didn't work and then had to go track down an employee. They gave me different key cards still wouldn't work. By this time I'm half frozen and to go back to the bar and they finally came with the master key and really had to hit it hard to open.  This nonsmoking room had cigarette burns in the covers and very bad odor to mask the smell.  The pillows were like little marshmallows.  I  hope them the best in their renovations because I couldn't wait to get out of there.

Text: Whoever said it was nice is a liar. We found a bedbug on the bed after they had told us they had no bug problems. We definitely got our money back.
