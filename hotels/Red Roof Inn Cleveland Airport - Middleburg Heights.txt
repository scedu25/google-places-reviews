Red Roof Inn Cleveland Airport - Middleburg Heights
Rating: 5
Text: Stayed in a king room with my wife while we visited Cleveland for our anniversary for 5 nights after booking via hotwire mystery deal.  Room had a king bed, wraparound desk with Comfy office chair, and a leather lounging chair.  Bed was comfortable, a little plush for my liking, but I have a firmer mattress at home.  TV was average for a hotel with your typical pay movie choices and free HBO. King rooms also have a nice mini fridge and microwave. Room was clean when I arrived and room was a cool 66°.  They also offer room service if you're into that kind of thing, which is interesting for a budget hotel.  My only complaint is that the bathroom left me feeling claustrophobic For the right deal, I'd definitely consider staying here again.

Text: At the low price I was really expecting...well nothing. Was pleased to find a clean room, a comfortable mattress, and a coffee pot. It is no frills, but a good place to crash for the night.

Text: Clean, well-maintained, no-frills hotel at an inexpensive rate. Fully non-smoking and pet friendly. I would recommend it.

Text: Good price.  Quiet location.  Spacious and clean room.  A little bit of odor.  Couldn't be sure if it was cigarette smoke or pet cover-up.  Unnoticed after a few minutes in the room.

Text: Clean, cheap. No bed bugs in any of our multiple stays - crazy that this has become one of the most important things to look for
