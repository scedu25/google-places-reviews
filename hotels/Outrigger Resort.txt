Outrigger Resort
Rating: 5
Text: Older, but clean. Owner is super friendly and very accommodating. My husband booked a cabin without confirming size, what he booked too small for our family and they were fantastic about insisting we take a bigger cabin even though it was a weekend. Great little park that felt safe leaving kids to play with other visiting kids. Nice pool. Great access.

Text: Rustic, quiet place. Walking distance to Indiana Beach amusement park. With a variety of cabins to choose from, they can accommodate 2 - 16 each. Clean, air conditioned and spacious. Some cabins have full kitchens, some kitchenettes. Some with patios and /or lake access. BBQ grills outside each cabin. Fishing piers and boat docking stations are available w/ rentals nearby. The lake is perfect for all water sports and early morning fishing.   Staff is friendly and helpful. 
If you remember summer camp and liked it, this is the place for you and yours. Grab some bug spray and come on!  Just 90 mins from Chicago...a good getaway spot.   Rent out the entire place for a family reunion and enjoy the heated pool!

Text: Our family has been going to this resort for years.   We can not say enough good things about the resort and the family that runs it.   They treat everyone as family and you do not find this hospitality in today's world of corporate run resorts.   The rooms and cottages are immaculate and well furnished.   (One of these reviews I vehemently disagree with is the one that said they are outdated....if treating people like family is outdated then I guess they are!)   There is always someone to answer your questions, accommodate your needs or just make you feel at home!   I brought my children there and now I bring my grandchildren and extended family.   WE LOVE MARIE AND CHUCK AND THEIR FAMILY!
