Text: Very nice hotel! The entry area was set up nice and decorated pretty. The rooms were accessible from inside via elevators or stairs but there was a door you could exit from your room to a balcony outdoors. We staff was very nice. We arrived after a wedding and it was very late, the staff was quick to check us in and the room was really nice. Super comfy beds too!

Text: Stayed here for three days while attending a dog event in Gray Summit. Room was clean and bed was comfortable.  Room service skipped us on day so have to request towels and coffee. Also the AC/Heat was not working right. When we got to the room, it was cold. After a hour of running the unit started outputting heat. Which was good, but then it wouldn't stop. Then the next night it wouldn't work at all. Cold night in MO. Would I stay here again ?  Maybe.

Text: I would like to thank your Chef and staff at your hotel for putting on a great dinner on the evening of 9/14. Under circumstances that were beyond the club or Holiday Inns fault, the dinner was put on hold for almost 1 1/2 hrs. That is a feat in itself to provide an edible dinner! Thank you to our waitress DeeDee. She did a wonderful job as all of the waitstaff did. And the best salad ever!!
We did not stay at the hotel but it was very impressive. The front staff was aware of the delay when we got there and kept us up to date which was nice.

Text: It was really fun. My friends, family, and I all enjoyed riding rides. The employees were very helpful and enthusiastic. I guess since, I'm from the south I'm not use to the prices, but the prices of food was high. That's my only problem, everything else made me want to go again.

Text: We were there for an anniversary party. The venue is beautiful and the food was delicious. The wait staff was courteous and attentive. Not your typical Holiday Inn, more like a boutique hotel.
