Text: It's a bit cold so I didn't do much but they have an indoor swimming pool and a decent gym for a hotel that size. The front desk are very courteous and the dining area is one of the best I've seen. Also they have a very good variety of breakfast choices.

Text: Very nice holiday inn. Lobby with restaurant and bar area, open and inviting area. Rooms are nice and clean. Hotel is older but recently updated. Derek at front desk was really nice, met our needs and had a little fun with us too!

Text: We used the back 2 meeting rooms, overall a pleasant experience. The smaller conference room did have a musty odor I'm guessing maybe it's not used as frequently? But they had really nice table cloths in our main meeting room this time! Overall a good place to hold a meeting if you've got a lot of people attending!

Text: The renovated lobby and restaurant area are very nice and roomy. Derek who worked at the front desk was very pleasant and did everything he could to make our stay enjoyable. The air conditioning worked well and the hotel was quiet even with a soccer tournament going on in area. Would stay again.
