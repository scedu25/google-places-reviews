Baymont Inn & Suites Lancaster
Rating: 5
Text: I have been staying at Lancaster Baymont for work for about 2 years. I come about every 2 months for a few nights and always has been a pleasure. The staff are helpful and welcoming. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfy. The breakfast is always delicious and a great start to the day. I always look forward to coming.

Text: Horrible hotel. The linen and bathroom was not clean, hallway smelled like someone was smoking and it was supposed to be non-smoking. The room had an awful odor when I walked in and even stayed on my clothes when I got home.

Text: Room not cleaned, bed looked like someone just slept in it.  Did not pick up trash, towels or vacuum.  Did not replenish towels or other amenities.  Called front desk, no response as of 20 minutes, no apology, no indication they would take care of the problem.
