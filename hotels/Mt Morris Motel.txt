Mt Morris Motel
Rating: 5
Text: Clean room, with firm comfortable beds.  It's an older building with old fashioned keys on a key fob; you have to use the key to lock the door when you leave.  Door stuck a little, but we had no problem shutting our door, or getting it to latch. For $60/night double double I think that we got a good deal.

Text: The hotel was extremely run downand outdated. We had paid for three people to stay in the room and they had only given us 2 towels. The beds were extremely hard. Worst of all, our door. The doorknob locked, but the door didn't latch. You could just push it open. When we informed the manager, she came to our room and started slamming the door trying to get it to latch. Then she went into the room and stated trying to get it to latch from the inside leaving me and my friends outside. The she told us that someone could come tomorrow to fix it, maybe that night. It was already after 9 pm. When we raised a fuss about staying in a room with a broken door,she reluctantly offered for us to move to another room. I realize that it is a small town motel, I grew up in this town, but this was ridiculous.  I will not stay here again and I definitely do not recommend staying here.
