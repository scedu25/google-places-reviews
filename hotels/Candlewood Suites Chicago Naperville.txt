Text: I was having work done in my house and the family had to leave for 1 week.  I have 3 cats and 1 dog this hotel is great with all your pets.  Very very clean I would stay here again and again staff is totally awesome so friendly.  Most of all it's clean the rooms are equipped with full fridge,stove and microwave so you don't have to eat out every night if you don't want to. The grounds are very well kept they have a patio area with 2 gas grills.  I would highly recommend staying at this hotel!!!!!

Text: Could use a pool, or hot tub. Room was very nice. Shower and tub is great sized. Has a stove top but not oven, which was ok because we used a slow cooker. Maybe could have some muffins or bagels for the mornings, not a whole Continental breakfast.

Text: Clean room and facility Good location Rooms are a little dated and mine on this stay had an issue with a mold or mildew smell. I'm sure it was just my room but I wasn't offered any compensation for it. Had I been in town more than 24 hours I would have been more aggressive about it. Overall a good place to stay, I'm sure my issue was a fluke.
