The Spotted Horse Ranch

Text: Beautiful place! We camped for 5 days with 2 horses. Loved all the animals! The guardian dogs were great! The only downside was the trails were not marked well and most were not maintained. Very easy to get turned around. The bathrooms are not the cleanliest. But overall we enjoyed our stay!

Text: Terrible experience! I should have been concerned from the beginning when even our guide's horse kept stopping along the trail and she couldn't get him to walk. But the real issues came later when my 67 year old father's horse kept trying to buck him, to which the guide just kept saying things like "stop that" and "what's wrong?" to the horse. When she finally got off her horse to check things out, after multiple incidents, she could barely get back on her own horse! Later on, our guide took us along side a fallen tree. When my father's horse went a different way around the tree because he was so uncontrollable, my father got knocked off the horse and injured his hand. Finally at this point the guide switched her horse with my father's for the remainder of the ride. Having been around horses a lot in my younger days, I understand that they are animals with their own brains and personalities. But I can also tell you that these horses were poorly trained for their job of carrying inexperienced riders, including older people and children, and that the guide was completely clueless about how to handle even her own horse.

Text: My daughter had an appointment to horseback ride while on vacation with her father in Hocking Hills. He took her for their appointment. The woman at the front desk asked if she could help them; my daughter said she was there for her appointment. This woman looked my daughter's father up and down and said, very rudely, "You're too big to ride."  Now, her father is a large man, but he's not HUGE; he's also not thin skinned at all, but this woman and her eudensss had him in tears. HE WASNT EVEN THERE TO RIDE; she didn't even ask him if he was there to ride before so rudely addressing him!  I know that weight is a major consideration, and I respect them making sure the horses are safe. But a) he wasn't there to ride; maybe find that out FIRST and b) there is absolutely NO REASON for anyone to be so RUDE. I will NEVER let any of my six children ride here again; I will never go myself.  And I promise I will make sure that everyone knows that if they're looking for a calm morning outing, tear and drama free, this is NOT the place to go. Complete lack of professionalism and common sense.
