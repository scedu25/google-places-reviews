Text: This hotel seemed like a nice place to stay, but I will never know for sure.  The hotel website was not set up to handle reservations or to check on availability.  I contacted the hotel by using the email address on the website but never received a reply- after waiting for 2 weeks.  I'll be staying elsewhere instead.
