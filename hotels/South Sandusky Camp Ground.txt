South Sandusky Camp Ground
Rating: 4
Text: We have stayed in the Rend Lake Campgrounds in the past. This was our first time in South Sandusky. It's our favorite. We always walked to and through it from the other campgrounds. What we liked was the quieter nature of it, although it has the beach front here! The sites are somewhat level, but for our 40' motor home, our first site was a bit too steep so we finally changed once a level site opened up.

Text: Really like the campground but not a big fan of the really small rocks around the pad.

Text: We love camping here. Roomy, mostly shaded, quiet, water and electricity at each site, friendly people at the check in gates.
