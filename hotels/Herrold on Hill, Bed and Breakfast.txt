Text: A beautiful 18 century home where Alan &  Sandy will go out of their way to make your stay great. Choose any of the beautiful rooms , but also relax in the parlor or living room to read, watch TV or visit. But don't miss the screened porch. Sit back with a cold drink, feel the breeze as you listen to the trains and remember days gone by.
  The breakfast are delicious and beautifully displayed at a time of your choice.
 We stayed 3 nights in May 2014 and left feeling the host & hostess are now our friends. Can't wait to return.
