Text: Not too much to see. Could not get close to enough to see many of the animals.
The highlight of the trip was a people friendly roaming turkey that liked to be petted.

Text: We had an awesome time!! The post stated that we would be able to hold one of the baby raccoons. When we went to where they were I had to really let the girl let me hold one. We came all the from where we live to be able for me to do this an hours drive. I really love raccoons very much. I was so very very happy to be able to fullfill a lifetime dream!!!! I only wish I was able to hold that precious little baby a bit longer.

Text: A small ranch in the South suburbs with some exotic animals much more accessible than at the zoo. Check out their website for open house dates.

Text: Pretty cool place. Kids loved it. May of been better if there was more coordination while at the facility but it was well worth the money and the people were very friendly
