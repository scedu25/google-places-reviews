The Hotel at Oberlin
Rating: 3
Text: I was only there briefly, but I had a decent breakfast. I found the atmosphere to be nice as well with it's hipster/environmental vibe having been executed well. The staff was great and very welcoming too.

Text: Too hip for words. Ok, not really; actually, too concerned with ecological and other PC issues, link the loud DING noise on every floor in the elevator (this for deaf people?).

Also a bit steep in price for the area, despite being the only game in town.

That said, staying here was pleasant, if not ... anything worth praising.

Text: The hotel was extemely clean. Staff was friendly. Room was sufficient. At 3am a drunk wedding party came back to the room next door. Walls are extremely thin and we could hear them talking at a normal level and definitely when they were laughing and shouting. We called the front desk and they called the loud room which took care of the issue.

Text: Highly recommend the bisque soup-- delicious. Nice and friendly wait staff, nice environment, either really good food or really unimpressive. Ask if they are missing an ingredient (once when I was there they didn't have potatoes) and then avoid that and get something classic- like french toast- and you will get good food. Hit or miss, but if it's good it's delicious.

Text: Terrible customer service over the phone with Grace, you would expect much better with a hotel of this caliber.  She was unhelpful, rude and flippant, not a customer-oriented person.  It left me with a bad impression of this hotel and hiring of their staff.
