Text: Jill was very attentive.We didn't require much. We did have a breakfast and a lunch, both were dekish.  The Inn was charming and the scrapbook area was spacious. There was a die cut machine available that we had fun using all that we wanted. Got our creative juices flowing. Just scheduled a return visit and taking more friends.
