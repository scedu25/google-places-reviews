Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Wichita East
Rating: 5
Text: Clean and quiet room.  Beds are soft and comfortable.  Pool was closed due to cold weather.  Low rates and free breakfast.  Morning meal serving times are long enough for those who want to sleep in, then grab something to eat...I love it!  And friendly staff.

Text: The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The breakfast was pretty decent as well for the type of hotel. I didnt use much of the facilities. Overall I would stay here again if I was going to Wichita again.
