Hampton Inn & Suites Springfield
Rating: 4
Text: Pros - superior suites. Really like the layout with full fridge and large kitchen.

Great suite.

Very well received at reception.

Room exceptionally clean.

Great couch!

Nice Chair and Ottoman.

Pleasant Room.

Clean Hallways.

Good breakfast.

Cons:

The convenience store at front desk was poorly stocked. No meals in fridge. Had to go out to purchase a dinner. Really wanted to stay in and rest.

Beds a little hard.

Got to be a better way than to knock on doors all the way down the halls at 10:00 am to see who's still in their room so housekeeping can get in to clean.

Text: Very clean room and breakfast area, super friendly staff, yummy breakfast with many options. The pool is large and clean and has a chair for people with physical disabilities to allow them to get into the water. There bed was comfortable and we loved having a suite so our baby could sleep while we relaxed together. The only thing was that the pack and play we borrowed from the hotel didn't stay up on one side. It didn't affect our baby's safety and he still slept well. The front desk attendant looked for a replacement but all others were already in use.

Text: Great place to get a room in Springfield. Fair prices. Typical breakfast, you'd be better going to Waffle House or something for food though.

Text: Only in common areas and had breakfast. Great service, friendliest folks work here. Probably the nicest hotel in Springfield. Great location at Glenstone and hwy 44. I would always recommend for the business traveler. Shared a parking lot with steak n shake, which isn't bad.
