Acorn Oaks Campground
Rating: 4
Text: Nice, quiet spot. Lots of resident RV's there that could use some work, but the owner keeps the place nice. Great country store, recycling available, playground, activities in-season.

Text: Camp ground was nice, lots of shade, but owner is a little fruity and rude, Says no insurance to have a pool but allows kids to play and get hurt on the playground equipment, accused us of steeling wood. Continuously controlled what you can and can set out in camping area, Was very unprofessional and yelling at us for other people's dogs, kids, and trash.. if not for the owner I would have gave 5 stars.

Text: It was a quiet getaway with not too many people on Memorial day. Only reason for 4 stars is that there's not much woods. We loved it though!
