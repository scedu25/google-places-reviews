Hilltop Mobile Homes

Text: The people that have given this business more than 1 star are clueless!  The people that work here, especially Cindy, are unprofessional,  rude and cheats!  An agent of Hilltop offered to buy my Aunts place and then, Cindy copped a bitchy attitude and told my sister and I to leave, the day of the sale?!  She told us to get out!  She said she wasn't going to buy the home.  The next day we worked with another gal but Cindy took a stressful situation and created drama and more stress.  Plus, we never received  an apology for her pissy attitude? ! Stay away from this place...you'll be a happy person somewhere else!

Text: Pretty sure Hilltop's owner is just a slum lord. They implement rules and regulations for their residents but never follow their own rules. They're always getting fined by the City for either water being shut off at least 2 times a week in the warmer months or for not following city ordinances. Lot rent increases yearly. They can't even get the lot rent bill to the residents in a timely manner. Every other month you have to contact the office and ask them what the lot rent is (they include the water, sewer, and garbage pick up in it). Too bad there's nothing in the lease that says if you don't get a bill you don't have to pay. We would save about 5 months worth in rent. Years ago, this may have been a great park. With the current owner, it's just a slum situation. She's hard nosed and has absolutely no compassion or empathy. I can only hope karma comes around to bite her back for her lack of humanity.

Text: Our mobile home was paid off about 3 years ago. Still, we are paying lot rent plus water and trash collection. Sounds reasonable until you discover that we are paying more now that the house is paid off than we were before it was paid off. How the hell are they charging the same amount for a small lot that they'd charge for the house itself? It makes no sense. They are heartless, cold-hearted, soulless people working there. 

My husband was injured at his job last year, and had to go through physical therapy for over 6 months to be able to work again. He was receiving workers' comp, but wasn't receiving even half of what he was making when he could work. Every month during that time, we had run ins with Hilltop, like they can't understand when bad luck befalls someone. Now, we are struggling to get by, and they keep raising the lot rent, and we asked to pay a partial payment til the end of the month, and Cindy refused to take it. Gave us til 4 p.m. yesterday (3/20) to come up with $420. How is that even possible?! Again, we called today because we could not find $406 yesterday, and she refused to accept the partial payment, and now has said they have already contacted their lawyer, which will tack on $150 or more to the bill.  $400+/mo. for a mobile home built in the 1960s! smh Ridiculous!

Text: Water is off all the time.  In fact it has been off all day today 8/30/16.  Poor management.  Lot rent is increased each year @ $5 a month, $60/yr.  Park is not very well taken care of.
