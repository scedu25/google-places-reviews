Text: Stayed here with a group. This place is basically a flop house with a new paint job. Daytime staff is awful. Night guy was very good. Had to get new key cards just about daily for four days straight because they constantly reset. Part of the Marriot now I guess, but they should must be too embarrassed to actually put their name on the sign. No fridge. No coffee maker. Outer door locked at night because the card reader is broken. If you like Pop tarts and cereal, the continental breakfast should be right up your alley. Do not stay here on purpose!
