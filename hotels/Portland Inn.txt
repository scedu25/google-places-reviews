Text: For the price, this place cannot be beat. The room was the cleanest I have stayed in for a budget hotel, the front desk was courteous and friendly. It's a simple place, but the beds are comfortable, the rooms are quiet the shower is hot, and everything works as it should. Would definitely stay in again if I were in the area. Plus, Pizza Hut delivered right to my door, a great solution for any wedding induced drunchies. Also, the hotel is not owned by Middle Easterners (referencing earlier review), the owners are definitely South Asian. Get your head straight.

Text: Went to the hotel and asked to stay one month and he said he had monthly rates but he was sold out after one week so charged us for one week and then before the week was over I went to ask him if he had any availability for another week and he said only in a bigger room which was $140 more than our first week. With everything else sold out in the area we stayed and during that week several of my husbands co-workers came in asking for rooms for a months stay and he had availabilty for every single one. After asking him why we lied and made us stay in a more expensive room when he obviously had other regular rooms available he just nodded and said everyone gets a different deal. Check out time is stated as 11 am it was 1045 and they came barging in and started to clean when I was still taking a few bags. Our stay absolutely sucked and got completely ripped off.
