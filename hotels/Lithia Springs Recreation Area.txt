Text: Camp hosts are very rude and un-organized. People next to our camp site were very drunk and loud all night, older man that is camp host basically shrugged his shoulders and said deal with it. We asked to move to another camp site that had no one on it but they said it was reserved online and "the guests could show up at anytime", those "guests" never did show up. Very disappointing that the Corp. would employ people like that. Seems like camp hosts are just there for their own pleasure and could care less about their paying customers. Disappointing experience all around.

Text: The rv spaces are good. Level and shaded. They offer full hook up spots. The beach is nice with a shower are 50 yards away. Pets and alcohol are welcome. Small park can walk it all in 30 min. Bring a BOAT lots of ramps and parking. Be prepared for the Check in at the gate (no people skills). But they are volunteers
