Holiday Inn Express & Suites Sparta
Rating: 4
Text: Nice clean rooms. Very comfortable beds!!! Was undergoing construction so no continental breakfast! Staff very friendly and professional. Highly recommend to everyone visiting the area. Dining in the area is not very good. The hotel needs a restaurant! A good one! That is all that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars.

Text: The hotel was booked solid for the eclipse on August 21, but the staff rose to the occasion magnificently.   The desk staff was friendly, courteous and helpful in answering any questions that we had.  Elizabeth Brown and the rest of the housekeeping staff kept the rooms neat and clean, as well as dealing in a friendly, hepful way with any small requests made of them.  Miss Diana provided us with good, fresh, warm breakfasts each morning, whether we came down late, in the middle of the breakfast period, or even a few minutes before it started!  The food was always good, warm and fresh; and the coffee was never stale.  All this, and the rates were reasonable into the bargain!

Text: Staff extremely friendly, my first time visit to town of Sparta. Holiday end very attentive. All your possible personal stores and eateries walking distance and movie theater.

Text: Friendly staff rooms are okay but outdated, for instance the television is not widescreen it's the old Square kind. There are many attractions around the area though which make for a nice visit.
