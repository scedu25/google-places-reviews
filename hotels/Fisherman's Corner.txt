Fisherman's Corner
Rating: 4
Text: Park is run by Army Corp of Engineers so prices are very reasonable. Nice, peaceful &quiet setting. Spots are spaced quite nicely between each campsite and easy to maneuver into.  Sites are electric only with 1 water source in the campground and the other at the dump station at the entrance. Even had a little book exchange box at the office.

Text: Fisherman's Corner Campground easy on easy off from Route 80. Paved level sites with water and Electric and two dump stations. We had site # 3. I would definitely use this Campground again when passing through the area.

Text: We like camping here because of its location.  It is on the bike trail which we like.  It is close to all the activities in the cities. My advice is to use Google Earth to check sites when booking and to be sure to check the size of the site. They are strict about where you park your vehicle.  There is no parking on the grass.

Text: The NW spaces are way to crowded. Try to stay out of the 40s
We were on 43 & still had a good two weeks. Clean bathrooms/showers
