Courtyard by Marriott Topeka
Rating: 4
Text: Convenient location with tons of restaurants around. Hotel is a bit dated but still nice. My biggest complaint is the shower head is shorter than me. Staff is very nice and it has the typical courtyard bistro.

Text: The lady working the front desk was great. For the most part the room was fine, but there were a few issues. The tub faucet dripped and was pretty annoying if I was in the bathroom area, but I did not notice it while in bed. However the air conditioner was also leaking. When I went to close the curtains, my socks got soaked and I realized the carpet around the a.c. was wet. Then around 2:00 in the morning I woke up to a really loud dripping noise. I turned the air off and it eventually stopped. Of course then the room got warm. I might stay there again but I would want those things fixed.

Text: Location is close to shopping and dining. Staff were friendly and helpful. Property has a secluded entrance which made it feel more secure than other hotels.

Text: Didn't have a good experience here. Check in was fine, but when we checked out the front desk attendant was ruder than could be and didn't even look us in the eyes or thank us for staying. She was very short and very rude. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Sadly will not be back.
