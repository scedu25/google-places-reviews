Text: Wonderful hotel at a great price. Room included a king bed and a sofa sleeper with two separate TVs for $120 including fees. Complimentary breakfast was very good!

Text: The staff was very nice. They acknowledge you as you come and go, making sure you're happy and that your needs are met. The rooms are clean. Ours actually had a kind of a living room as you make your way from entrance to bed, with a second HDTV and small stereo. Also had a mini fridge and microwave. The breakfast was awesome for a free one. Not that the options were terribly different than other hotels, but just tasted great! Scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, English muffins, make your own oatmeal, waffles with strawberries, and then other options like fresh fruit, cereal, juices, etc. Just really good. I'd stay again, no doubt!

Text: The best part of the stay was the staff. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is a bit run down. The hot tub was out of order and the swimming pool was so murky that we choose not to swim in it. Overall the stay was good especially for just one night. The rate was reasonable. There are eating places nearby also.

Text: Stayed only one night on my way through but was pleasantly surprised on all counts. The bed was comfortable, the room spotless, and best of all, the desk clerk exceptionally warm and helpful.  I would stop there again for no other reason than the friendliness of the staff!

Text: I stayed at the Fairfield for one night on business. The room was quiet, the bed was soft, the shower was hot, and it was Halloween so the front desk gave us candy! A great stay.
