Text: I was laid straight to the front gate through divine intervention. Seriously, I kidding. Been going there since 1989. So peaceful and healing. Just wish the cafeteria and shop was open more often and longer.

Text: Felt the positive energy the first time I visited.  Lovely grounds maintained on ancient Native Indian grounds.  Easy to find.  Many different experiences there. Have experienced healing both physically and spiritually. Intend to start taking classes.

Text: Well...I wanted to have an amazing experience, but apparently I interupted the person at the welcome desk's work and he was abrupt. He gave us a booklet and a map, but the booklet only had classes listed. I had no idea the background or history of Camp Chesterfield. The book store and cafe weren't open. We went inside the art gallery, but it smelled very musty and it was hard to breathe. We also felt very weird because we had interupted a class that we didn't know was happening. The lights on the other side of the gallery were not on. I still have no idea who lives on grounds, the history or anything. Very disappointed for my first time visiting.
