Text: We stayed here for 3 nights. We tent camp, the site was right beside the river. We fell asleep to the sound of the river running by about 15 feet from the tent. The staff are helpful and friendly. The grounds are well kept and the shower/bathroom very clean. This is one of the nicest campgrounds we have stayed in. We tent camp every year for at least 2 weeks and often stay at 3-4 campgrounds. The is the 1st positive review I have written in many years! I hope they keep up the great work and attitude!
