Text: For those individuals of non-white descent, reconsider booking this hotel unless you enjoy facing racial discrimination during your stay. 

The staff here is completely unprofessional and racist. As I was enjoying my breakfast, I was confronted and asked "Do you have a room here?"

Text: Nice decor. We had a one bedroom suite that could have been better laid out.  The bathroom should have been between the living room and the bedroom.  Awkward setup. I also wish they had a hot tub for us weary travellers.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We would stay again, but not pay the upcharge for the suite.

Text: I stayed at the Country Inn for nearly a week on business, as everywhere else was full. The rooms are relatively clean, but they are definitely dated. There was rust in the bathroom and the shower head was half red with the buildup. The WiFi was poor and unfortunately the Ethernet plug in my room didn't work. The internet would drop out for minutes at a time, and then pop back online.

Text: People were very friendly.   Check was very easy eith no hastles.  There was trouble with the cable though and wifi connection left a lot to be desired.  Bed was very comfy and clean.  The room could use some touching up.  Overall not bad, but not overly impressed either.
