Text: We got what we paid for. Very cheap. The beds were hard, the shower broke (couldn't turn it off), the non-smoking room reeked of old cigarette smoke, and the door was hard to open/close. The people running the place were super nice, the sheets were low quality but clean, they didn't request much info at check in, and we didnt hear the other guests. Would I go back? No. Would I suggest this place to others? Not unless they are hiding out.
