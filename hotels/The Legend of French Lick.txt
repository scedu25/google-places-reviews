Text: This absolutely is not a hotel.   These are dorm rooms.  This is someone's house.  Don't book this place.   The place is gated for a reason.  Driving down the road to get there will tell you why it is gated.  Very creepy, nobody there, no security.  We did not end up staying there.  Management/owner would not give a refund.  Money is better spent elsewhere.   Dont book this place!!

Text: The Olympic suite is fantastic.  The room is large and has a very comfortable bed.  Only complaint is that the TV in our room is pretty small.  The 21" TV is dwarfed by the large accommodations.
The bathroom is perfect and exceeded our expectations.  We are hoping to come back and visit again in the future sometime in the summer so we can enjoy the pool.
