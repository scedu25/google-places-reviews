Text: The fair itself is nothing special, but I go to the races regularly and have never been disappointed. Always a lot of fun. Figure 8 races, mud drag races, and other events throughout the year. Disappointed that they don't really do the demolition derbys anymore though. But if you've never been to a race here, definitely try it!
