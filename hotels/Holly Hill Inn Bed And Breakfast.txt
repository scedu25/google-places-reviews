Holly Hill Inn Bed And Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: Old bed and breakfast from 1836! On top of a hill, looks out over the town and river. The owner, Bruce, was awesome! So accommodating, friendly and loved talking to him. He is an amazing cook - breakfast was home fries, French toast, bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs. In addition to the best homemade blueberry scones!! The rooms were very comfortable and clean. Would absolutely stay again

Text: We stumbled upon this little gem on a road trip between Durham, NC and Chicago, IL. It was such a treat and we are DEFINITELY coming back here. Great place for a romantic getaway or a family trip! Bruce was so incredibly hospitable and nice, it was hard to believe someone that nice actually exists. But he does. AND he's an equally incredible chef! You are in for a TREAT with his hors d'oeuvres and breakfasts!!! And if you love historic charm as much as we do, it is the perfect place for you, seeing as it's the oldest house in Pomeroy. It is so lovingly and beautifully restored that it makes you feel transported back to the 1830s. HIGHLY recommended!
