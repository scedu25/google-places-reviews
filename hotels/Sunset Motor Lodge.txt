Text: I called to find out how much the rooms are as the prices are not listed on the website. The phone rang 5 times, and when it was answered I didn't hear anyone say anything. Before I could open my mouth the lady that answered rudely said "hello?!" and was rude and short through the whole conversation. No way I'm spending my money in a place whose employees can't even politely answer the phone or provide information.
