Hidden Acres Campground

Text: I was looking for a place to do some seasonal camping for the summer of 2018.  I had previously camped at Pier-Lon in Lodi as a kid and looking to get back to camping.  There is no way I would consider camping at this place once I read the owners response to a reviewer on here.  Just the most unprofessional response I have every seen.  You can totally see the point some reviewers are trying to make about the owner.  Look for the response from Frank Marilyn Hlad, you will make up your mind right on the spot.  Shame too, the pictures looked very, very nice.

Text: In response to Ashley Clark review, personally she is correct! Not false statements! And for a public review she is allowed to state what happened in whatever way she pleases. Not very mature for a business to do business the way they do and want to call someone out for their truth. If you don't want bad reviews I suggest you change the way you treat well paying customers!

Text: This mobile home and campgrounds resort is a great place, very friendly and family oriented. Has a lot of activities such as fishing, canoeing, swimming, horseshoes, out door movies and much more! Its very laid back and is a beautiful place to just relax. Remember its camping, NOT the Holiday Inn!
