Holiday Inn Express & Suites GREAT BEND
Rating: 5
Text: Newer hotel with a modern feel. The room was very clean and the pillows are very comfortable! The breakfast was ok, but it's free, so I am not going to complain. The pool was warm and the hot tub actually hot. I will come back in the future. The family had a great time.

Text: The hotel is newer so that was nice but it wasn't worth the $20 extra a night that we could have saved staying at the comfort inn. The pool was Very cold, so we only swan once, and the second day there none of our towels were replaced which I unfortunately didn't notice until after I showered that morning (thank god we hadn't used the hand towels!)  Also when we first checked into our room there were sticky hand prints all over the window which isn't that big of a deal but kind of spoke to the attention to cleanliness. They took my number because they were going to call me if I left anything. I left my new 10 phone ft charger plugged inbetween the beds (very noticeable) and when I called them the next day they hadn't found it. Save your money and stay at the Comfort Inn.

Text: Nice clean rooms and public areas. Breakfast area was designed well and efficient. Breakfast items were very good for a buffet. Hot food was hot and cold items were cold.

Text: Had car troubles and stopped here for the night. They took our puppy which was a great plus. The have rooms are very contemporary for the area and are clean. However, the rooms are loud, I could hear anyone coming? and going from their rooms. Also for a new room (a suite) our a/c unit sounded like a truck starting up, all night long. Other than those problems the stay was great. Nice pool and lawn areas outside. Close to a grocery store and a Walmart.
