Text: My new wife and I stayed here for 2 nights to start off our honeymoon before leaving for Lake Tahoe.  The house is far enough off the main street where traffic noise isn't an issue.  Her breakfasts were amazing and she treated us like family.  The hot tube behind the house was private enough that we didn't worry about others disturbing us.  We will definitely be coming back here to celebrate one of our anniversaries someday.

Text: Nita's was a wonderful place to call home for the time we were in Aurora.  The food was worthy of 5 stars and we were treated like one of the family.
