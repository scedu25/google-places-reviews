Corbin / Laurel Lake KOA Journey
Rating: 5
Text: We stay here every fall as we travel to and from Myrtle Beach.  It is always great with nice level pull through spots large enough for our motor home towing a car.  Nice pool and bathhouse, too.  Pet play area is a great way to let our dogs stretch their legs after a day of travel.

Text: Friendly staff and great shade.  It's all hilly and gravel lots.  Pool is well maintained but they didn't clean restrooms the whole time we were there.  Camp Store is Spartan but there are plenty of stores nearby.

Text: Very nice staff, lots of trees and shade if you like that, but satellite TV won't work, but they do have a good cable system.  

If you are a big rig and want to use this as an overnight stop in a pull through site, then it is very very tight.  I managed to get out of my site without unhooking but it was only by inches.  But unhooked it would be okay.  Sites are not real level.

Text: The  bathrooms were dirty, the sites  poorly marked, and worst of all the owners niece, Cassie, who checked us out was sadly rude. When we asked for a receipt for our records she became nasty noting we did not need one. I explained we had came in the night before after hours and paid cash, $40.00, and wanted a record of the transaction.  She finally gave us one.  People don’t want to be treated poorly. If KOA is attempting to standardize so folks can have a good camping experience this place spoils the efforts.
