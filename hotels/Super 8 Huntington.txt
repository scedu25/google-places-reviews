Text: I have bed bug bites on both of my arms from the hotel and we didn't use the comforters because they had stains resembling consummation juices. The breakfast was also disappointing and the pool was never fixed like they told us it would be.

Text: If I could give this a no star rating I would. I had called earlier in the week to see if we could check in earlier then 1:00 was told no problem. We arrived at 1:30, thirty minutes passed normal check in time. Our room had not been cleaned yet we had to wait 2 hours to get into our room.  Then our room had not been vacuumed, the bathroom was still grimy. Then we saw the sheets and mattress cover. The sheets were gross but the mattress cover had urine stains all over both beds. Ewww we asked for replacements plus clean towels, an hour later I went down and said I was leaving and wanted a refund. They asked if we would stay if they put us in a cleaner room. Ha Went to comfort Inn way better.

Text: Lobby smelled, AC in rooms only , the rest of the motel was very hot . The blanket on the bed was stained and the sheets although clean were very dingy , both bedskirts where stained, shower curtain was moldy. Dirty floors in the lobby.  The lady at the desk was very nice though.

Text: The overall stay was good enough. We needed somewhere to sleep and the bed was comfortable...the only complaint I have is the pillows aren't that great but that's easily fixed.
