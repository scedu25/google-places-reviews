Quality Inn Lake Of The Ozarks

Text: I gave it a 4 based on location, those working here and room size. It is a 2 story with no elevator and a very long building. It almost looks as if they added on as business picked up.
2 pools 1 inside and 1 out. Both pools are very big and well maintained. The spa which is inside wasn't working during my stay late Aug 2017.
King rooms are very large with 2 chairs and 32in flat screen, microwave that popcorn actually turned in, mini fridge and coffee maker. The bathroom is pretty small but you don't spend that much time there anyway. Kind of musty smelling but for the price, location near everything I'll stay again.

Text: Walked into room upon check in to find Trail mix scattered all over the floor. There was no trash can in the bathroom.  Call front office told we would have to bring up the issues with the manager when he came on duty. He was not there the entire weekend. Waiting for call from the division manager.

Text: The bed was very comfortable. I have stayed there a few times because thats where my job puts me up at. I know that they are going to remodel this winter but have had issues with something every time.

Text: Its affordable, and very close to tourist spots. Nice hot breakfast, the two pools are well maintained. Only thing is the hot tub is not very hot.
