Text: A very quaint mom and pop motel. The rooms are always clean, the grounds are very nice and kept up, the owners are also some of the nicest , sweetest people you'll ever meet. Close to town and a route 66 treasure!

Text: Don't be fooled by the facade the website gives. Happy to stay at budget motels with expectations to match. This place was not priced accordingly. The bathroom door had a huge hole at the bottom of it, from a dog trying to get out. I am a Engineering Supervisor for a hotel. When we have problems like this we put the rooms out of order until repaired. The room I was given should be condemned.

Text: Our experience was that this is a nice, clean, SAFE, quiet, affordable mid-20th century Motel. The staff went out of their way to make everything nice and even memorable for us. It is, in many ways, a true "Time Capsule". We WILL be back.
If your looking for the REAL "retro" life, this is the place. If your going to complain about how this is not like a modern Holiday Inn, then keep your "corporate self" away from here. "You won't like it, and, it won't like You". (7UP, 1960)
