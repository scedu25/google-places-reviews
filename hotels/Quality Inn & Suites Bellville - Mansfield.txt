Quality Inn & Suites Bellville - Mansfield
Rating: 5
Text: I was quickly checked in and was given directions to my room. Then the friendly young man told me about the accommodations , which included a swimming pool, hot tub, and breakfast. After I got into my room, the front desk called and asked if I needed anything or a wake up call. The room was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Text: Just stopped in for a night while traveling. Excellent price for the elegant accommodations. Best nights sleep we had the whole time we traveled from Buffalo, NY to Denver. Friendliest and most attentive staff. Great breakfast!

Text: The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, with soft sheets and comforters. The pillows were down, which aren't my favorite, but I won't hold that against then. The AC, microwave, and refrigerator all worked well. There was also a tv, safe, coffee machine, iron and hair dryer, but I didn't use them so I can't attest to their quality. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels. There were lots of plugs for electronics, even a usb charging hub.

Breakfast was nice. They had fresh waffles, biscuits and gravy, fruits, yogurts, pastries, cereal, eggs, and probably a few things I missed. The breakfast area had plenty of seating.

The best part of our stay was the costumer service. We called about a room after a long day of driving and when we got there they were kind and had everything ready to go. They called our room to make sure everything was alright and made an excellent recommendation on where to eat for dinner. 

If I'm ever passing through again I will stay here.
