Text: Had a great stay here. Bathroom door wouldn't close, but it was perfect in every other way. Breakfast was surprisingly good, including scrambled eggs, sausage, and biscuits and gravy, along with all the usual breakfast offerings. Would gladly stay here again!

Text: Great place to stay. Newly updated and they did a fine job. Breakfast is the best we've found. Caring staff, safe place to stay. Plenty of good place to eat nearby or delivery.

Text: Room has been renovated, which it is modernized but I’d rather still take an old fashioned room without piss on the toilet seat...after not being able to sit on the toilet I didn’t even want to shower....it was also too late to go & change rooms, not a chance I was willing to take if I ended up with something worse...the bathroom counter was very low, maybe for handicap people? Also they still have the old heaters/ac in windows that u cannot set on automatic sensor so either u are too cold or too hot...I turned it off it was too loud also & was cold most of the night. Breakfast fast OK...powder eggs that I don’t like to eat... pork, pork & boiled eggs. :(

Text: We stayed here a couple of years ago and decided to stay here again.  The facility is a bit older but has been redone so that it feels like a newer facility.  The staff is nice and pleasant.  One thing that is nice is you are within sight of the interstate but you do not hear it.  It is very quiet.

Text: Staff was fun and nice. They are doing construction on some rooms but worked to put me as far from it as possible.  I would stay here again.
