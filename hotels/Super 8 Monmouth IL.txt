Text: Enjoyed our stay here. Staff was professional and attentive. Location was conveniently located in town but was very quiet. We will be back again!

Text: We arrived late to a fully booked hotel, except a single room with a broken shower. Mr. Patel discounted the room for the night and provided a clean room for us to shower in the next morning. He was extremely helpful in every interaction. When he realized we finished breakfast with empty coffee pots, he made a fresh pot and called our room to let us know.

Text: Every thing in my room was nice and clean. No smoke or sinful smells. Pulling in to the parking lot is threw the store next door. So if you are going west the traffic light just before the motel will be the turn to get in the parking lot.

Text: Nice place, well kept... Maybe over priced or maybe it's a "We charge according to who what and when"...
