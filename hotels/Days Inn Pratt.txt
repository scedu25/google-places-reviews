Text: Staff was amazing. We went to a motel before this because it was closer and they wouldn't take us, they didn't even try so we called Days Inn in Pratt and they found a way to squeeze us in. We broke down about 20 miles away from Pratt after driving 20 hours from Arizona and just needed somewhere to sleep while our car got fix. And the rooms are actually pretty nice for being in a very small town. Even though we only stayed 5 hours there while we slept, it's one of the best experiences I've ever had with a hotel.

Text: The bathroom never got warm, the shower head was clogged and you could not turn off the shower to use the tub.  The stairs were wobbly and partially broken and the front desk guy could not find our Wyndham rewards number. On the other hand the room was clean and beds comfy

Text: Room was large and clean. Beds were comfortable and the room had a mini fridge and microwave. 

Outside wall was very thin and we could hear everything going on outside also, had to unplugg the phone at 2am because it kept ringing and wasnt coming from management. Very strange. 

Hotels past this point west are very few and far between. If you are traveling keep this in mind.
