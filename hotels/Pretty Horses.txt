Text: Our plans changed and we needed a place to overnight with 5 horses when we left Denver. I called and Julie immediately checked her books and said she would make room for us. This place was so clean for horse and human. They have hook up for trailers but we used the bed and breakfast. She had snacks, beverages and a light meal ready for us if we wanted. She went over and above to make us comfortable and to help us. Highly recommend and will be back any time we travel out west again!! Thank you again!!

Text: Stayed here while PCSing from Colorado to Ohio.  Very easy to get to from the highway. Very good horse facilities. The people accommodations for good too. Nice private room with den area and good coffee. If you were traveling along I 70 and looking for a place to board your horse is, this is good if you were in the Fort Riley Kansas area.

Text: What a great place to stay with your horses! My wife and I were on our way back to Florida from a stay in Colorado with 3 horses and 2 dogs. We didn't know exactly when we'd be leaving the mountains in Colorado, and we couldn't call Julie and Wayne because there was no cell phone service where we were. We were a few days late on leaving the mountains, but Julie was extremely understanding and flexible.

When we arrived at Pretty Horses, Julie and Wayne set us up in a very comfortable shady spot near the barn. The barn and horse runs are really nice with lots of room for the horses to move around. Lots of cool fresh water right by the horse runs.

Our hosts were very friendly, and we even got some fresh tomatoes right out of the garden! We spent the night in our own trailer, so we can't offer much insight about the bed and breakfast. But, judging by everything else we experienced there, I'm sure it's nice as well.

If our gang is ever in the Chapman area again in the future, we'll be staying at Pretty Horses. We would recommend this spot to anyone - and don't forget to ask about the Osage oranges.
