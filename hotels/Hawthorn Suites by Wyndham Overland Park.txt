Text: Stayed for two weeks. Very clean. The staff were all polite and did anything they could to help. This was our end of summer trip and will go back again. Thank you to all staff for making our stay so good. Great hot breakfast breakfast to get you going for the day and very good location.

Text: We got a great rate at the last minute. We were impressed by the space and fireplace. It does lack a bit of polish.... Peeling paint. Kitchen really needed some attention. Mantle was missing in fireplace. If you're fussy, then maybe look elsewhere. The breakfast though was very good and for the same price, we'd be back!

Text: On business , listen if you want to stay at a 5 star hotel whip out the cash. If you want a place to stay in a nice convenient area this is it. It's Reasonable , I can't say the same with others in this price range. Room was clean and quiet. Some of these negative reviews must have been from people who complain just to complain are they are used to staying in luxury hotels. The breakfast is a huge plus they offer meat. Enjoy !

Text: The layout of the facility was interesting and neat. It was more like an apartment complex than a hotel. The breakfast was well above average and included offerings beyond the usual fare. The room itself was adequate, but the furnishings were a little worn and the carpet is old and needs to be replaced.

Text: I stay at this hotel 8 to 12 weeks a year My most recent 10 night stay was excellent with a clean and very spacious room. The full kitchen makes this the best deal in Kansas City / Overland Park area for longer stays....nearby extended stay hotels are 1/3 the size and do not have a full kitchen. I am happy to say I can highly recommend this hotel!
