Dreamland Motel

Text: Honestly..... The staff is very nice. The room seemed fine when we got there. Then we went outside for a bit. Came back in and turned on the lights and there were dozens of roaches. We couldnt sleep well all night and it was raining. If they cleaned it up a bit it might be ok but i will not return there. Not worth the 45 dolllars.

Text: Friendly workers, I've stayed here weeks at a time and haven't seen bed bugs, roaches, etc.. Just a simple motel and cheap but at least it's somewhere clean and the people that work here are great too get along with!! No they may not have swimming pools, and other things but you can't beat it for $45 a night.

Text: By far the worse and dirtiest place we have ever stayed!!! Bugs, moldy walls and very outdated!!! I wanted to puke when I walked in.
