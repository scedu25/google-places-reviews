Text: A clean, beautiful mobile home park that is a peaceful and safe environment to enjoy your life. Spring brings the beauty of Bradford pair trees in bloom. The park entrance welcomes its residents and guests. The maintenance staff maintains the trees, roads and exterior needs of the tenants. Come to the pool in the summer and bask is the sun and meet your neighbors.

Text: My experience with one of the office lady was terrible. I was go to my friend but she wasn't home so I thought I go in in the office to ask if they have new or used mobile homes for sale. The Lady who  was sit there she was nice with me but than from other room another lady came out with application in her hand and she told me I have to have excellent credit to get an mobil home there.
 What? excellent credit? Or just because she saw  my skin was a little browner than her.....(I look like Mexican)  My friend just got a mobil home there (she is white) and her credit not even near to good credit. Right now I'm paying the mortgage because I have good credit (not excellent) and the bank gived me loan with "only good credit" to buy a house. And when I told them that my friend live here and she don't even has a good credit the two ladies just gived to each other a look.....
Oh, so.... I understand: in Knoolwood Estates Mobile Homes in Freeport  IL the white skin people even with bad credit can live there, the brown skin people (or what can I say,  really dark skin people) only with excellent credit can live there. Ha!!
Thanks No! With this kind of racist lady in office even if I can have an excellent credit I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE THERE!
