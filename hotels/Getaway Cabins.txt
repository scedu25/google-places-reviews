Getaway Cabins

Text: We have stayed at Getaway Cabins several times. Everytime we stay we have enjoyed everything about the stay. From feeling like we are all by ourselves to clean neat cabins. The stay is always something we look forward too.

Text: As I stated on Yelp, my husband and I were so excited for this trip! We have two young children and we were long due for a break, we walked in with candles lit, electric fire place on very romantic. For the occasion the stay was what we need 3 out of 5 rating. There were crumbs in the couch (not from us) sheets were a little dirty, dead bug under our bed, shower was yellow (gross). Moldy sponge in the sink. We did appreciate the hot tub and privacy of the cabin we picked hummingbird haven! (Ants on the sink, bring spray)  next time I think we'll try a different company. The people that work there are very nice though on the bright side!! I did not call and complain my husband wanted to he was very disappointed but I just wanted to make the best out of what little time we had together. Not sure, we'll be back to this resort. I think they need a better cleaning services!!

Text: The wife and I go yearly as an anniversary get away for the both of us. The cabins have always been super clean, they smell nice and are always welcoming. The staff have always been super nice, and helpful. The area that the cabins are in are at times spooky quiet! You can hear leaves falling out of the tress from 50 yards away. Hot tubs have always been in full operation and clean, the outside grills have always been clean and full of propane. Worth every penny in my opinion.

Text: We stayed at 'Bears Den' for a 4 night stay. Completely exceeded our expectations! Very secluded, beautiful scenery, and the cabin itself was so rustic looking and exactly what we wanted. The pictures online don't do it justice! It was a great place to celebrate our daughters 1st birthday. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly during every encounter. Be prepared for no cell service or internet, just make sure you get your maps ready ahead of time :-)
Only as a 'hey this could be a way to enhance the cabin', it would have been cool if there were screen doors to the porches, so the doors could stay open. This did not take away from our experience at all, merely a tid bit of what could make it even better :) 
If you're considering staying at a Getaway Cabins property, do it!!! I can't wait to check out another property in the future!

Text: We stayed at the Guest Nest Cabin, loved it!  Had a great weekend.  Our cabin was cute, clean and our bed was comfy.  The feeding station was a hit, a buck, doe, raccoon, rabbits and turkey!  A good location to everything.
