Text: Last minute reservation for a wheelchair accessible room, turned into quite a deal. The front desk person for check in was very sympathetic, assisted handling luggage and even openned up the room for me. Great people and a descent breakfast with make it yourself waffles.

Text: My daughter and I stayed this past Saturday and really enjoyed the place. We had a peaceful time. The front desk help were very helpful and nice, breakfast was great, everything was hot and fresh. Only problem was the rain storm shut down the cable for the TV.  The light show outside was great though.

Text: My wife and i stayed here when we got married and a year later for our one year anniversary both times in the jacuzzi suite. We had a blast here both times! The jacuzzi is huge and has very powerful jets. The beds are comfy as well as the room itself. Very friendly atmosphere and a great Continental breakfast. Lots of restaurants and shopping around the area.

Text: Got the last non-smoking room and it smelled like smoke. The temperature was set at 62 so even though it was 85 outside I had to turn on the heat to take a shower. The soap dish was broken off the wall and there was hair all over the toilet. 
The front desk employee could hardly understand anything that I was saying. 
Not the quality that I've always expected from Quality Inn.

Text: The exceptionally clean rooms were greatly appreciated the beds were the most comfortable including the pillows out of any place we stayed on our trip so far. I will definitely recommend this Motel and make it a point to stop there every time I'm on my way to Colorado.
