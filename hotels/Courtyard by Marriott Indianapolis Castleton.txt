Courtyard by Marriott Indianapolis Castleton
Rating: 5
Text: Rooms were extremely clean. The balconies to the courtyard was awesome. Breakfast was good, but not free, and if you're in hurry I'd go somewhere else.

Text: Typical Courtyard Marriott but I like typical Courtyard Marriott. Check in was smooth and easy. Rooms clean and staff friendly. Very quiet but maybe it's my timing, doesn't feel like many people here.

Text: Attended a meeting for a state nonprofit organization this weekend at Courtyard Indianapolis Castleton. Staff was helpful and courteous, facilities clean and well maintained. The courtyard area is gorgeous and a great place to hang out.

Text: Full disclosure: I'm a platinum elite member, so I judge a little bit harsher than some others may. My stay here was great. I would rate it 4.5 it off 5 rather than 4 like I did here on Google. Why? Purely because of the areas that are not in line with the updates of the hotel. They've done a great job modernizing the lobby butt once you get into the hallways, you sense the age of the hotel. The room itself was updated but too much "smell good sence" was used I making some sort of odor. The biggest demerit I have is the bathroom. Everything else was updated except the tub and tile. Am i nit picking? Yes. But when I stay at a Marriot, I judge them harsher than Joe Blows motel. Otherwise, the facility was clean, the staff SUPER friendly, and has a nice bistro/bar in the lobby area. Parking is plentiful and very well lit. Update those bathrooms and I'd give it a 5.
