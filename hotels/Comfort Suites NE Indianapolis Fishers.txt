Comfort Suites NE Indianapolis Fishers

Text: Simple and straight forward. Clean and well appointed rooms. Bed was comfy with plenty of pillows and outlets. Bathroom was efficient and clean. Didnt try the breakfast. Room price on a busy weekend was a little high for what I got, but that's how supply and demand works.

Text: Good value and clean room. Fire alarm went off for 3 rings during the night. Then again for 3 or 4 rings every 20 minutes for over an hour. Went for breakfast at 730 am and no food. Not sure what the problem was.

Text: A good Comfort Suite. You know what you're going to to get. This property has followed the standards. Great friendly check in and room was clean. Rooms are big. Only problem was the Directv satellite signal. It was spotty and it was just a little cloudy outside
