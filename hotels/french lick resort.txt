Text: Nice hotel, comfortable beds, could be better at cleaning the rooms though. They do have a lot of kids activities all the time which is great if you are traveling or visiting with children. The valets and bus drivers are the best employees there! They are amazing and super friendly!

Text: A definite 5 star place to escape. The rooms have character of a old style hotel yet are very comfortable. There is so much to do at this resort from fine dining to golf,horseback riding and pickle ball just to name a few. The casino is small but has plenty of action. I always arrive with a smile and leave with a bigger smile. Highly recommended.

Text: As always, the French Lick Resort never fails to impress! This time my husband and I visited in order to take in the historic tour of the West Baden Hotel followed with amazing cocktails under the atrium and a brisk evening stroll on the beautiful grounds. We can't wait for our next visit!
