Courtyard by Marriott Peoria Downtown

Text: Room was decent, pool was nice (my toddler loved it), some of the guests had no concept of quiet hours, but were kicked out in short order. The bed was fairly comfortable too. I wish the room had a microwave or a room service menu. My only real complaint has to do with a marathon in town closing access to park in the complimentary parking, but even then they let us park in the valet spots for free.

Text: Very pretty and comfortable lobby and quiet enough for work, lots of nearby outlets. Breakfast is Starbucks and they serve some hot breakfast options. Parking is in adjacent garage and skywalk back to the hotel. Great experience so far and friendly service! :)
