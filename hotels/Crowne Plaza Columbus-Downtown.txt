Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown

Text: Great location with parking right behind the building. Good brewery in walking distance is always a huge plus. Check in was fairly slow. The 3 star really comes down to the bedding. Bed seemed older, sheets were starchy and the pillows were tiny. Hard to find good bedding. I didn't book the room so I can't comment on price.

Text: I have to say that that the staff is very helpful! We were there for a convention and they made it very easy on us. The rooms were on the small side and had some signs of wear. But they were clean and comfortable. We had a very pleasant stay!

Text: Good location, clean, typical of a business-oriented hotel.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Rooms are also very business-typical; most having 2 queen beds, flat-screen TV, and refrigerator (no microwave was available in the room I was in).
This is a decent hotel, but nothing was extraordinary about it.  Would stay here again if the price is right, but wouldn't go out of my way to book a future stay.

Text: Staff is great. There were a few slips the cleaning crew made, but nothing major. The price is reasonable, especially if you are there for something in the convention center. Even better if your event is in the north hall.

Text: This hotel is conveniently located in downtown Columbus near the convention center. I stayed here while attending a conference. The rooms are comfortable and decently sized, and the staff is friendly. Breakfast is provided buffet style at the Max & Erma's restaurant attached to the building. There is a maximum of 2 complimentary breakfasts per room.
