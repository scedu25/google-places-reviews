Days Inn Salina South
Rating: 5
Text: It's a Days Inn, what would you expect. The ladies running this place are excellent, super kind, very friendly towards kids and families, probably because they have big families of their own. They made us feel very welcome and made sure we had everything we needed and then some. Rooms were clean, bedding was nice clean and made up well. we recieved a pet room as we had pups of our own and there was no odor, no stains or anything wrong with the room at all. Everything worked and was easily accessible, they even helped us out with a local water park that was fun fun. Not likely I'll ever be in the area again, but if I do end up back there i will stay the night just because.
