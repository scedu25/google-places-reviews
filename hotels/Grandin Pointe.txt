Text: We've lived here for 21 years and I just have to say that this company has made this a miserable place to live!! They state that they sent out a letter stating no pools were allowed in Jan of 2016. We never received said letter and had our pool up all summer last year. This year 5 weeks after putting our pool up the office manager came to my door and rudely told me we had 7 days to take it down. Then one of their gophers delivered a letter stating that if it wasn't taken down in 7 days we had 30 days to move our home. We are in complete compliance with the law as far as having a 6 foot privacy fence to keep young children out of our yard and safe from the pool. Plus the fact that they've raised the lot rent by $50 in less than a year and a half. Doesn't matter that we've paid our rent on time for 21 years only matters that they think they can control my life. Looks like we'll be moving soon!!!! If you've heard bad things about our   previous owner just know that he was a dream compared to these  people. My advice is don't buy or rent from these people it's only a money and control game for them not building a decent community to live in. Too bad I can't give them a zero or a negative number because I would but one is the lowest I can give.

Text: Bought my home for more than it was worth. Manager is super disrespectful and rude. They had a maintenance man come knock on our door and tell us we had to have blinds on our front windows even though the room dosnt get used. I ended up calling them and said that the rules never stated that i had to have any blinds up and so she told me if i didnt go get some and put them up they would evict me. How unprofessional and against my right to live in poverty and piece!!

Text: They hire anyone to be a manager. We lived there and paid our rent and the manager took our money so corporate made us pay again! We moved out after that! Horrible place to live! They don't fix anything. My daughters wall fell in due to mold and they kept saying they were coming to fix it and never did
