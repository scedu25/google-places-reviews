Extended Stay America - Wichita - East
Rating: 4
Text: Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Despite being surrounded by construction the location was easily accessed because unlike other nearby hotel turn instead, this had a stop light. The lady at the desk was nice. Only complaint is the weak water pressure.

Text: Staff was helpful. Rooms were clean. Seemed to be relatively updated. Only issue was some minor disrepair issues. Leaky toilet and a couple smoke detectors hanging from the ceiling.

Text: Gross !
Room smelled awful, I got this dirty vibe, toilet overflowed all over bathroom.
They have a small exercise room, but you feel like a rat in a cage and on display, since it has a big open glass window and your right in front of the elevators.
Maybe they did it that way, as to entertain people waiting on the elevator !!!!

Text: We arrived late at night but the front door was locked and no one would answer the phone. Eventually another guest let us in but we still had to go find the clerk to check in. The breakfast was instant oatmeal and the rooms lack coffee maker even though it has a kitchen. It's probably a good hotel for longer stays but if you're doing a one night it's best to look elsewhere.

Text: Great stay, great staff.
It's not luxurious but great for road vets.  Full kitchen, no need to eat out every meal.  Like home on the road.  Better value via Priceline unless you want to collect points.
