Text: We had a wonderful time at the Shawnee National Forrest.  The Willowbrook cabins were very nice and comfortable.  All we had to bring was ourselves.  Everything was provided for us.  We highly recommend these cabins!

Text: Nothing but the finest for my customers. I hold photographic workshops in Southern IL and I and my guests stay at Willowbrook Cabins. Besides the fact they are most centrally located to so many of the photographic opportunities, it's just such a great place for my guests to unwind after a long day of photo touring the Shawnee. These "Cabins" are packed with all the amenities one would have at home. Comfy beds, sofas, chairs. Even the kitchens are stocked with all the utensils necessary to feed a group or family. Top it off with nice clean functioning washer and dryers and it's a setting anyone would feel comfortable in. They even have weber grills, and a fire pit for each cabin. Carrie and Doug, your hosts are nothing short of awesome people. What ever your reason for going in the Shawnee Forest, this is a great place to stay. There is even a gas station/convenient store just 3 miles away for those last minute runs. I highly recommend Willowbrook cabins.
