Amber House Bed & Breakfast

Text: The entire weekend [stayed there the weekend of Nov 3rd] at the Amber House was delightful. Everyone was friendly and polite. They really have an organized and well thought out way to operate this establishment. Food is delicious, decor is beautiful and even the music they play while you eat and socialize is spot on to such a relaxing and peaceful weekend!

Text: My husband and I wanted a little getaway for our first year anniversary. The Amber House was the perfect place for us to stay. Dawson and Sherry were such great hosts and went above and beyond for us. The room and house was very beautiful and elegant. Dawson served us an amazing gourmet breakfast with warmth and hospitality. Sherry even does massages there. 

Rocheport was such a cute and quaint town. A few things we enjoyed were Les Bourgeois Winery and Bistro, Abigails for lunch, White Horse Antiques and Stockton Mercantile for some shopping, and of course riding the Katy Trail.

We highly recommend coming to Rocheport and staying at The Amber House. We will be back!

Text: We came upon the Amber House by way of a Google Search of hotels near Booneville, MO as we were going to visit Warm Springs Ranch.  Wow! I'm so glad we found this place. Sherri and Dawson have a beautiful home and were just so personable and friendly. The house was impeccable. The bed in the Onx room was so comfy and I love waking up to the smell of a great coffee. Dawson cooked a delicious breakfast and we were full for hours. My Mom and Sister stayed in the other guest rooms and raved about the how well they slept. I highly recommend the Amber House.  Best B&B I have found to date.  Keep up the great work Sherri and Dawson!! PS: Loved Mazzy too. She was such a friendly and sweet kitty. Thanks for sharing your home and providing such an incredible stay.
