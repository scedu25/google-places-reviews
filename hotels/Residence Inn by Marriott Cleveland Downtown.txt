Residence Inn by Marriott Cleveland Downtown

Text: Loved this place. The location is fantastic and couldn't be any better. The second floor rooms overlook the Arcade from the hallway, which was quite unique and gave the hotel a quaint feeling. Service was friendly and accommodating and the rooms are equipped with everything you'd expect from an extended stay property. They even have a coin laundry. I loved the high ceiling in the rooms themselves and how spacious they were. The bed were comfortable being in the middle in terms of hardness, which means you didn't sink into them. They also had some mixers on a few of the weekdays.

The place was great. Very clean and superb customer service as usual. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very spacious. Food was good also and kept me very satisfied. I really enjoyed my stay and was sad when I had to leave.

Text: Booked a room online for a 2 nights stay at the Residence Inn by Marriott Cleveland Downtown. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was very nice, newly updated and had everything in it that we needed including a kitchen. Free breakfasts were included which was awesome. We paid 60.00 for valet parking which was a nice extra considering the location of the hotel is in walking distance to 4th. Street, the Q and the Jack so you don't have to worry about paying for parking all over the city. We stay here often because of the location and price. It pays to be right in the center of the city.

It was a pleasant stay at the hotel. Spacious suite room, with clean and tidy service. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. Breakfast service is decent compared to other places.
