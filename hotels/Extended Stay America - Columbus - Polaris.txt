Text: The staff was very friendly and helpful. I do think maintenance could be better. My room had a weird damp "pool" smell and little details were missed like pulling the bed skirt from under the mattress on one end of the bed and fixing the curtain so that all the rungs were attached properly. The room slept 5 of us - 2 adults and 3 children- comfortably. The location cannot be beat. If you're looking for affordable accommodations and can overlook the small stuff, this place will definitely meet your needs.

Text: Got this place for last minute Rock On The Range hotel. Couldn't really complain that much. the place was pretty clean and quiet but the fact that every time I took a shower and opened the bathroom door the steam from the shower would set off the fire alarm... so yes I showered everyday we were on vacation.. and yes it went off probably 7/10 times. I'm totally down for the whole pets are welcome too but the pee aroma in the stairwells were not very delightful.

Text: Very impressed! Customer service is stellar.  They have 2 attendants at the front desk even in the evening,  which we don't see very often! They made sure to tell us EVERYTHING that was available to us, which is a lot! They were very respectful and polite!

The room is incredible for the price! Kitchen, couch and chair, TV, two working spaces, and very clean nice bathroom! The king bed is nice, too! One of us likes the pillows and the other doesn't  (just because the other is particular about pillows and always brings their own)

One of the few hotels we've stayed at that we feel deserves five stars!

Almost forgot to mention that the attendants said they don't do housekeeping during our stay,  which is really nice because we're used to waking up to loud tapping on other guests' doors and "Housekeeping!" which is why one of us always travels with earplugs! Not at this hotel!
