Story Inn
Rating: 5
Text: A true back in time to a community frozen in 1930s. The Story Inn is a great place. It actually has rooms or small homes you can stay. The inns restaurant has a great menu and food very good. Everyone was friendly and very informative about the history of Story. Even about the ghost that resides at the Inn.

Text: Unique place. Located while running the Harleys on the  back roads. Had a couple of good ole boys playing music on the outside patio. We sat out there and had burgers cooked on open fire. Pretty sad burgers. Overall it was enjoyable and I would come back just because of the atmosphere.

Text: Overpriced and bland food, decent service, amazing old-fashioned atmosphere, uncomfortable chairs but it fit the surroundings. By no means was it the best restaurant in Indiana. Ribeye steak was good but not exceptionally hung or stored for seasoned flavor (end cut req.).  Pork chop was good but had no flavor, it was like what I fix at home in a crock pot. Beers were cheap and good. Skip the restaurant and go to the bar downstairs.

Text: It's a very small, charming, out of the way little place that takes you back in time. The scenery is wonderful, the restaurant is fantastic, and the service is impeccable. It's very out of the way. And very hard to get to by normal standards, but that's par of its overall charm. A short drive away is Nashville And Brown County State park, and all they have to offer as well.
