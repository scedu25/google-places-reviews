Council Bluff Lake Camp Ground
Rating: 5
Text: Campground is really nice. Each site has a lamp post for your latern, picnic table, fire ring, a covered type shelf for keeping supplies off the ground and dry, and level cleared tent pitching area that would accommodate roughly a 12'x12' tent. Fresh water spouts are plenty and right along the drive that goes through the campground. Bathroom facilities are plenty with one or two newer bathrooms in the camp area. If you come before memorial day the beach area is closed and that is where the shower facilities are. When I say closed, I mean there is a gate across the road to get to the area. Also firewood vendors are not easy to locate, so make sure you find where they are before you get there and save their location as a way point in your GPS if you use one. Cell service is almost non existent,  ( using Verizon) which is fine with us but if you have to Google a location to get directions, it isn't going to happen. Mark all way points before getting out there in your GPS. Great place, family, kids, dogs.

Text: Amazing campground facilities. I love that you can shower here. It has so many ticks though so bring long pants and lots of bug spray.
