White Lions Bed And Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We booked a night at the White Lion based on reviews, and if anything it exceeded our expectations. Our hosts, Kayla and Mike, greeted us as we pulled into the driveway and helped us carry our luggage to the sumptuous room with a comfortable king-sized bed. She had even baked a strawberry cake which made for a yummy midnight snack! Breakfast (cinnamon-sugar-nut buns, yogurt with granola and fruit, and personal baked frittatas) was amazing. I also noticed that towels for the two-sink bathroom were plentiful and exceptionally fluffy. I have never felt so welcomed at a b&b--so much so that we want to return and spend more time in this picturesque Iowa town. Happy to highly recommend.

Text: I saw that some pinhead only gave these folks 3 stars... what a moron. I travel all over the country and this is one of the best B&B's in the nation.  The owners are super cool, they are always welcoming and the place is spotless and comfortable.  It's the best be tin Winterset, Iowa.

Text: Kayla and Mark were the BEST hosts! Every detail has been carefully thought of, thirsty robes, keurig coffee, luscious mattresses. Very friendly!

Text: We've stayed at both the cabin and the Queen Anne home and loved them both.

At the cabin you feel like you're out in the wilderness as there's no other home visible to you.  You're there with just the lake, wildlife and woods.  The complete kitchen makes it easy for you to cook your own meals - or order a pizza for delivery from town, just two miles away.  Very comfortable large living room with attached patio.  Separate Dining room. Great setting for our family get together.

Queen Anne home is beautifully decorated with antiques and hardwood floors.  Lots of comfortable seating indoors plus on the porch.  Very comfortable rooms.  Ours had private bathroom.  Breakfast was delicious, and hosts Kayla and Mark are warm and friendly.  We'll definitely be back.
