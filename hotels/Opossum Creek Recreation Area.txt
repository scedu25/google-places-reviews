Text: Just stopped by to see what spots were open and background on the campground. Very friendly staff gave us a visitor's pass and a map and let us explore. We looked at full hook-up and primitive. Very well layed out and all spots are beautiful on a d off the water. Lots of bath house and a great play ground area.
