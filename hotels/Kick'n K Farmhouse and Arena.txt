Text: Kick'n K Hosted our wedding.  The owners are awesome and went the extra mile to make sure our big day went smoothly.  They started a bonfire for us and helped us find a caterer at the last minute.

The ranch is absolutely beautiful.  We rented out the entire place and stayed in the cabin, leaving the farmhouse for some of our guests.  It's a wonderful place for an event or just a weekend getaway and is ran by wonderful people.

Text: This place was amazing.  Very quite, very clean, as clean as a five star hotel.  Everything you need is there.  Enjoy fresh air,  country life, a hot tub that overlooks a small creek.  Just bring your groceries, that's all what you need.  The owners were very nice.  Definitely will be coming back.

Text: My girlfriend and I are from St. Louis and just wanted a long getaway weekend, We had not heard of KicknK before but took a chance, because the price was just right, and booked the Sunrise Cabin for a long weekend in November 2014. The cabin was amazing! Super cozy, great privacy, and a private hot tub looking out over the valley to the river. You bring your own food and drinks. Its really a my house is your house feeling. And that's how the owners wanted us to feel. Just a real nice private piece of land and they said we could go explore wherever.

Speaking of the owners...

The owners were some of the nicest people ever. They gave me there cell number in case there were issues. I actually texted them around 10 at night asking a question about the hot tub and they were happy to answer. We got to watch them practice in their horse arena for a rodeo show and then let us ride the horses. They offered us beer to drink. That evening we actually met up with them at a winery just a couple miles away and hung out with them. They were great people! Hospitality that is second to none!
