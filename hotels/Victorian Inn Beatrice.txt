Victorian Inn Beatrice
Rating: 4
Text: In Beatrice, NE for a wedding, we stayed at Victorian Inn for 3 nights. We had a spacious and clean suite with useful amenities. Staff were friendly, courteous and professional. We enjoyed the indoor pool and complimentary hot breakfast. Overall it was a comfortable and pleasant stay, and we would do it again.

Text: As expected for a cheap hotel. Rooms clean, pillows plenty but thin. Matress hard. Free WiFi with faster paid speed. Good 2 ply toilet paper.

Text: Nice little hotel, clean updated rooms. Matresses are a little hard. Breakfast was decent but recommend Country Cooking or Aunt Mary's. Friendly helpful maid service.

Text: Very friendly staff. Had a problem with the door locking, instead of trying to fix it they moved us to another room. Easy as pie. Very nice and updated rooms. Breakfast had plenty of choices. I will definitely stay here again.
