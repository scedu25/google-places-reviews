Text: Good hotel for the price. We stayed one night. The fan in bathroom was crazy loud(maybe broken) there was a spot for a light but no bulb above sink and one of the beds cover looked like it had cigarette butt holes in it. Liked having fridge microwave and wifi that worked. If i stayed more than one night i would probably ask for a different room or to get ligh/fan fixed.
