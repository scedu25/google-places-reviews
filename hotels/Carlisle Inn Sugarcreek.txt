Carlisle Inn Sugarcreek
Rating: 5
Text: I visited the Carlisle Inn in Sugarcreek to get my senior homecoming pictures taken. The Carlisle Inn did not disappoint. They have picturesque views around every corner, and you feel like you have to take a picture at every location. The people in the hotel let us take pictures freely in the lobby, and were very nice to my photographer and I. Overall, due to the kind service and beautiful location, I give the Carlisle Inn in Sugarcreek an easy 5 star rating.

Text: It's Amish country, beautiful rolling hills, gorgeous scenic sunsets and of course horse manure scent haha. I had a great time. Rooms, service, and staff were excellent. My bed was stiff but everything else was great. Beautiful hotel.

Text: I was so impressed with this hotel. Especially for the price! Nice indoor pool and hot tub is open until midnight. Free cookies and popcorn at night, free (really good!) breakfast in the morning. Steps away from a fantastic restaurant and cafe/bakery, a gift shop, a theatre, and a market. Tons of stuff to do, including Breitenbach just a few minutes away. Not to mention the hotel itself was just gorgeous. Recommended, and I'll definitely be back.

Text: We, my 3 girlfriends and I, we're in the suite in the 4th floor for a weekend girls trip. I have never been so amazed by a hotel. There were 63 out of 69 rooms filled but you would never know it. It was beautiful, clean, and quiet. The rooms were spacious and clean. Did I say CLEAN. The staff were helpful and sweet. I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend this place.
