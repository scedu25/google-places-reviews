Text: Got a single queen sized bed for $60 or so, plus a $15 dog fee cause, well, I brought my dog. Full disclosure: I am reviewing this with price in mind. The room was clean and mainly comfortable, but the bed wasn't the softest nor highest quality. One star knocked off for that. WiFi worked great, staff were helpful even though i had a very late arrival. Breakfast was very simple, i grabbed some coffee and packaged blueberry muffins. They did have waffle maker, didn't use it though.

Text: This hotel is in need of some TLC in every aspect. The room was large but not too clean, the shower had nice water pressure but dated as was the furniture. The room door had a busted door lock and the deadbolt wouldn't work either essentially a card from the outside could open the door as u slept. 
Breakfast was not supplied well, waffle machine had no oil and all the waffles stuck to machine, waffle mix was empty only had 1/2 cup of batter and after sticking was a complete waste of time. Butter patties were frozen, the milk was warm, and juice machine empty. The bed was comfortable and the tv worked. The staff was cordial but not overly friendly.

Text: Friendly staff, drama-free check-in. Comfortable room with great desk and task lighting. Clean, but white bedcovers were stained with black marks.

Text: Not a kitchen in the room! We booked this hotel due to it advertising it having a kitchen and paid more per night. When we arrived to our room it had a counter with a sink. This is what they consider a kitchen. See photos. The hotel was not secure as well. The side entrance door was broken due to someone trying to kick in the door. The beds are very hard if you like hard beds.

Text: It was pet friendly I was happy about that and the room was clean I just was disappointed the ad said indoor pool is why I came but nevertheless for the price it was cool.
