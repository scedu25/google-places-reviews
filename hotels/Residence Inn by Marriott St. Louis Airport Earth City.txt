Residence Inn by Marriott St. Louis Airport/Earth City
Rating: 5
Text: Nice hotel to stay at. The rooms were cleaned and well maintained, the staff was friendly. They offer shuttle service to the airport and had the perfect location for my visit. Also has a gas station and a McDonald's in walking distance. The gym felt a bit cramped, but overall great hotel. I would stay here again.

Text: Room was clean as was the rest of the hotel. Very friendly staff who helped us check in. The room had all the amenities that you'd expect for a Residence Inn. Parking space was ample and we had no issues finding a spot. Breakfast has something for almost everyone, both cold and hot. Seating in the area for breakfast is kind of low, so you might be taking your food to your room. The hotel is easy to find from the road, and has a gas station/McDonald's next door.

I recommend this hotel for those visiting Earth City, especially those with pets.

Text: As mentioned from a prior stay, staff here are willing to go above and beyond to be sure that you are getting your money's worth. They keep you apprised of the weekly events held in the common area, and seem to have some pretty good first hand knowledge of places around the the Earth City / St Louis area (staying at many other establishments this can sometimes be hard to come by surprisingly). The only knock I have is the television sets. I am currently on a business trip with my supervisor, and we frequently require the use of a bigger screen for sharing content or attending a meeting before heading out, and all the models used are an LG variant that seems to suffer from a global dimming setting that cannot be switched off. The TV's are locked down (so people cannot change all the settings and screw it up I'd imagine) and no display settings can be altered. When the normal lights in the room, or outside light from the windows needs to be blocked off to get a decent picture.....it just seems to be a bit much. Bottom line, fantastic facility, and staff, and highly recommend the place, just not the best TV's.
