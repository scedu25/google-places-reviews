Econo Lodge London KY
Rating: 1
Text: Smoking room had no openable window, rooms open to hall way, not outside. Hallways are pokey and creepy. Bed covers were burnt with cigarette holes, and so were tables. The shower was great. But the room smelled bad even for smoking rooms.

Text: Great rates for us as disabled seniors. Didn't get a chance to use the pool due to family obligations on this trip. Clean room, convenient location in London KY for visiting local family. Continental breakfast was good with lots of variety. I would use this establishment again.

Text: The rooms were not cleaned, the shower still had hair in it. The overall condition of the room was poor and staff was rude.The sliding door on the bathroom was broken. They claimed since I was alone, I didn't need a door! Ugh...I won't be going back there.
Update;
My sister in law had problems with her a/c in her room across the hall. None of the rooms had the air on when we got there, but hers would not cool at all. She went down to the front desk and they agreed to give her a new room, however, it was the dirty room with the broken door, that we just left. The cleck declared that he cleaned it...nope!

Text: Will not stay here again. Not clean and the rooms were hot as a sauna when we arrived. Not friendly at the front desk. I would not recommend this hotel.
