Text: The owners of this facility do not follow safety regulations, as the 2nd floor railing is loose enough to fall off if touched. Cleanliness is definitely NOT a priority at this place, as management will only clean what they have to in order to stay in business. There are several roach and bed bug infestations of which are never under control. Also, the staff harasses tenants when they decide to move. When I left, I found several notes on our door from management calling us a liar, and that he did not believe our story. The place also costs too much, as they charge by the week (Even though their sign says monthly or weekly). I would not recommend this place to anyone on Earth.
