Lakeside Cabins Resort

Text: My husband and I stayed here with our three young children over Labor Day weekend.  We were so impressed! The pools were very well maintained and the beach area is perfect for kids to play all day. The grounds are well kept and the cabin was clean with a great screened in porch. We will absolutely be back for another long weekend.

Text: We have been going to Lakeside Cabin Resort as a family and with a group of other families for 11 years.  We love it so much!  It's such a relaxing place for the parents and adults and we love how close it is to the beaches.  The cabins are all nice and we love spending time on the screened in porches listening to the trees.  The kids love the game room and the staff is very responsive to any need.  Great for groups.

Text: We just got back from a long weekend at the resort. It is a great location for families. The cabin was just the right  size for our family, the kids loved the sleeping loft. The resort has a small lake with a sandy beach and kayaks, as well as two pools and a playground. It is quiet and beautiful. We will definitely be back.

Text: Another great weekend at Lakeside Cabins Resort! We returned yesterday after a fun weekend hanging out at the resort and in and around Three Oaks for the Apple Cider Century. We highly recommend this location if you are planning to ride in the ACC. We have made it a two day trip from Chicago for several years now and our teenagers continue to enjoy this tradition.
