Text: I've lived in Shelbyville my whole life and only just now stopped in to Gregory's, and I'm glad that I did. Great customer service and fantastic breakfast. They work well with what they've got. If you're camping at Lithia, it's a must-do.

Text: It's not the ritz or even motel 6. But it is rural America with great hard working friendly people. Clean, and kept up. Has the feeling of a guest room not motel. The little store with home made breakfast is to die for.

Text: We stay at Gregory's 2,3,4, I wish it was more, times a year at Lake Shelbyville. Rich, Mary, and the kids are great people. Sometimes I catch fish and sometimes I don"t, but I always have a great time and a lot of laughs with Rich and his family. See you good folks soon.
