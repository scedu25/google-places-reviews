Text: I recommend this place to anyone. Very friendly people that works there. Very clean, comfortable bed, easy to get in and out to go see the attractions. Their  breakfast bar was great food and very clean. My husband likes to be able to drive up to our door to our room to unload our luggage. Even though I had to go through the main lobby to get to my room the first time we still had a door from our room that opens to go out to our car. Overall I rate excellent place! A 5 star rating!

Text: Had a great stay. It's in a great location, they also have a shuttle bus that will pretty much take you anywhere in town. I would highly recommend this place!

Text: Friendly Staff and clean rooms. We've traveled to Dodge many times the last two years and have stayed at a few other hotels. Best Western is the the absolute BEST!  Never disappointed.

Text: We had a very nice 2 night stay here.  The room was clean, reasonably priced and we had  plenty of room to move around.  We especially enjoyed having a mini fridge and microwave.
