Text: This motel leaves a lot to be desired. If possible I'd give it less than one star. Internet only works in the office; none in your room even though it was promoted to be available in each room. Cleanliness was very questionable. Room had not been vacuumed recently. No bath mat.  Supposedly this was a non-smoking room, but someone must have been smoking nearby and ithe smell migrated to our room. The breakfast area needed to be cleaned and the frig was especially gross with spilled sticky juice all over inside. We will never stay here again and recommend anyone else avoid it also.

Text: I reserved this room because it was supposed to be a 2.5 star room and its not.  I dealt with the disappointments because I did not want to deal with reserving a new room and needing to move all of my belongings.  Yesterday, Saturday October 7 2017, I came back to my room for lunch and my key didn't work, so I went down to the office to key the key reprogrammed and came back upstairs and the key still didn't work, so I had a maid open the door for me. After my lunch, I was heading back out to work, and the maid stopped by to take out the trash.  As I was sitting in the car, she tried to leave but the door to my room but it would not shut. So I got out of my car and went up to talk to her and explained what had happened when I came back for lunch.  She went down stairs to get the front desk lady and she came up, and after doing a series of things, she was able to get my room door shut.  Well, when I came back to my room about 6 hours later from work, my room door was open!!! I have my laptop and 2 printers and all of my luggage and belongings in my room.  I went downstairs and told the front desk guy about it and asked him if there are any other rooms that have this problem and he told me there are a couple of other rooms that have the same issue with the doors not closing.  This is completely unacceptable!!  I am leaving again for the field and if this happens again, I'm asking for a complete refund!  Never in my life as an insurance agent, have I ever experienced anything like this.  I travel for my job in 5 states and the fact that they know about this problem yet do nothing about it is intolerable. To be honest, I don't know why I am giving them another chance.  When I told them my concern and complaint, nothing was done.  They didn't offer me a new room or anything.  If I wasn't on a time crunch, I would not stay at this hotel.

Text: This hotel has hazardous conditions, including clothes racks coming out of the walls, door chains broken and nonfunctional, and smoke detectors without batteries. When we didn't feel comfortable staying here they wouldn't refund our money. Do not stay at this hotel, the management and owner are not concerned with the conditions of their hotel.

This chain is an affiliate of Red Lion Hotels. If you have similar experiences, I encourage you to go to Red Lion's website and report it. They will, at least respond to complaints. Thank you.

Text: We booked the hotel online while on a road trip, but our transmission went out several hours before we were able to get there. We weren't able to make it, and the strict no cancellation policy caused us to lose our money, even in an emergency situation. I understand the policy, but there should be some leeway in case of an emergency. 

I am not happy with the way we were treated and hope this will warn others away from making the same mistake.
