Lincoln Way Inn Bed & Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: We absolutely LOVED our stay at the Lincoln Way Inn as we celebrated our 10 year anniversary. Lisa and her staff were amazing and made my husband and I feel so loved and cared for; it was hard to leave. Every morning we were served a gourmet breakfast outside in the garden pergola. It was a picture perfect setting and an absolutely delicious homemade meal (organic and locally raised/grown). During our stay we went bike riding, explored hiking trails, went fishing, enjoyed a picnic, relaxed with a massage, enjoyed time in the sauna and the list goes on and on. This getaway came at just the right time and it felt like a little slice of heaven. We cannot wait to go back!

Text: This was one of the best weddings I have ever been a part of. The best venue around for a small wedding. The owner Lisa is very accommodating. She thinks of every little detail.

Text: My husband and I have stayed at many B&B's in our travels over the years, and I can honestly say that this inn is at the top of our list of great places stay!  What a wonderful and peaceful getaway!  Comfortable elegance is the best way I can think to describe this beautiful inn.  The innkeeper, Lisa, is friendly as you could hope for, and goes out of her way to make your stay memorable.  The beautiful century old house has been updated with all the modern conveniences of the 21st century, yet maintains the classic beauty of  the turn-of-the-century gem it is.  The decor is classy yet comfy.  The grounds are well-maintained with a lovely patio and an impressive outdoor fireplace.  I especially loved all the beautiful plants around the entire property.  The food was abundant & delicious and Lisa caters to special dietary needs.  Nothing has been overlooked at this truly memorable bed and breakfast.  We can't wait to return to stay in another of the beautiful and unique rooms.  A huge thanks to Lisa for creating such a wonderful retreat in our hectic world!!

Text: Stayed three nights while attending a high school reunion in the area.  Definitely made the right decision.  The breakfast was over the top and the service was above and beyond.  Lisa and John have built a B&B with extreme attention to detail. Will certainly stay again when the next reunion rolls around in five years!

Text: My wife and I had our wedding here and stayed a couple nights in the carriage house. Everything was fantastic. The grounds are beautiful, the house and rooms are so nice, the breakfast was delicious, and the owners and staff are beyond wonderful. We couldn't have asked for more.
