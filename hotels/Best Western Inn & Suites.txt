Text: Complimentary breakfast was not good at all. Couldn't even break open my biscuit for biscuits and gravy it w as so hard. Room Lighting was very white and sterile feeling. Definitely needs some warmer lighting to make it feel more comfy.

Text: Very nice hotel. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The water pressure in the shower was not very good and it would have been nice if there were a few more options at the breakfast bar. I would stay here again.

Text: Nice hotel with nice beds and friendly staff. The breakfast was ready at 5AM and was pretty good with scrambled eggs and sausage. They slipped the bill under the door in the night and I just had to drop the keys at the desk on the way out.

Text: The towels were wet, not thoroughly dried. The breakfast was ok, they had the yougurt was locked up with no one with a key. Then when I left in the morning, the parking lot lights had not on all night. This place is not what I expect for a Best Western.
