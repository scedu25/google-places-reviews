Text: The laundromat sucks! Half of the washers and dryers don't work.  There are signs everywhere telling you what you can and can't wash.  Also, if you overload the washers, you have to pay for the repairs....lol. There is no air conditioning just a fan that blows hot air around. Pretty outdated, too. AND DIIRRTY! There is mold in all the washers. Oh, and if you have to go to the bathroom, you better do it in between wash cycles. If you go while the machines are draining, the toilet won't flush.

Text: I made friends with the owner (it's a small place owned by husband/wife). Fine service. Better rate than what sioux city had. Microwave and fridge. Decent clean. I may have gotten bitten by bugs the first few nights, but nothing for remaining 2 weeks.
