Text: Awesome pool. Had issues with housekeeping up until the day before we checked out (was there 5 days)... Breakfast was okay. Very friendly staff.

Made reservation 1 week prior. Didn't receive confirmation email. Called back and there was no reservation under the name. Made a reservation again that day... 1 day into our stay, there was an extra $100+ charge from the hotel for a "no show." They spelled everything wrong on the first reservation but got all the credit card information correct.... Thankfully the girl at the front desk was so nice and situated everything out and we received the refund about 2 days later.

Bottom line. I would stay at this hotel again in the summer weather. The pool is worth the cons. For $99 a night in a really nice area too. They do need to have better housekeeping though. The first 2 days I had to vacuum my own room. Also they are pet friendly with no extra charge.!!!

Text: The hotel was very clean and modern. The rooms were nice and provided many outlets to charge all of your gadgets. The staff was courteous and helpful. My only very tiny complaint was the breakfast. I don't need it to be fancy, but if you offer bagels you had better have cream cheese!

Text: I really enjoyed my stay at La Quinta. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was good. It was within walking distance of a Denny's and we got 20% off by showing our hotel key. I will definitely stay at this hotel again!
