Country Stage Campground
Rating: 5
Text: We were fortunate to have found this campground nearly a year ago.  We absolutely love the well maintained facilities - including the new, enormous playground that our grandchildren have enjoyed several times -  the fishing (and yes you can catch more than a bluegill!).  They have activities to help bring everyone together - cornhole tournaments, family movie night, fishing derby's, crafts and water weekends.  More than all that though, the campground is full of genuinely nice people that enjoy cutting loose and having a good time.  The owners are wonderful people and we really enjoy each weekend we get to spend there, and despise going back to the "real world" when it ends.
