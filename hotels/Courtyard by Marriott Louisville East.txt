Courtyard by Marriott Louisville East
Rating: 1
Text: Not worth the hassle - stay at another Marriott property. My king room was not available, so I was put in a double handicapped room. Keys didn’t work TWICE so I had to lug my stuff back and forth three times. No microwave to reheat my food from the 30 mins it took to get into my room and then to top it off, the freaking TV didn’t work! No remote in the room, had to call the front desk lady who clearly hates me at this point via no fault of mine but because of the low-grade property. As a frequent traveler, I will not be staying here again.

Text: Typical experience for a Marriott property. Staff was friendly, but not particularly outgoing. This isn't a complaint... It's just that I expect a certain level of service and maintenance from a Marriott location. This Courtyard met my expectations, but they didn't do anything to exceed them.

Text: Great location off of the highway. Plenty of eating options nearby for dining. Dining options within hotel as well. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Great atmosphere and clean.

Text: Nice bar, and they had a Starbucks. Good stuff. Would have liked to be open later on a Sat night.

Text: Everything was perfect. A breakfast buffet would have been awesome as opposed to the paid breakfast made at the Starbucks within the hotel. That being said, it's a beautiful hotel well worth staying at.
