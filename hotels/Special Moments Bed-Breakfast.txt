Special Moments Bed-Breakfast
Rating: 5
Text: As a fan of the movie Bridges of Madison County, making the drive to Iowa was on my bucket list. I spent about 5 hours researching hotels and B&B's in or near Madison County and or Winterset. We travel with our adorable shih tzu, so pet friendly was a must. I called all the ones that matched our criteria. I originally wanted to stay in Winterset thinking it would be nice to stay in the city where all the bridges and touristy to do's were. Well, they were either all booked or no pets. I called Special Moments, which is in Orient, just outside Winterset, a very short, but beautiful drive. Luckily Carol, the in keeper said come on down. WOW...what a find! I am so happy the stars guided us to Orient! It is secluded, quiet, and picturesque. You get the true Iowa experience here. Carol was so amazing and friendly. My dog was able run and play on the 8 acres next to the corn fields. Our first night there we had the windows opened enjoying the cool breeze and quietness of the night. I was reading my book in bed and noticed flickering lights outside through the screen. I got up and was amazed at all the fire flies lighting up the corn fields! So beautiful and charming. Our room was clean and cozy. Carol has thought of everything, its all in the details. Breakfast was delish and coffee on the porch was the best. I could go on and on. So worth the short drive. I would stay here again, actually I hope to someday!
