Chicago Marriott Suites Deerfield
Rating: 4
Text: The room accommodations were good. The couch, chair, and bed were nice and comfortable. The room's pocket door for the bathroom was obnoxiously loud and wonky - loud enough to wake your partner. The event spaces were nice and the staff were absolutely wonderful! The breakfast buffet was okay - the potatoes were horrendous, but the other food items were good. The internet was also expensive - $13 to $17 per day?? What a rip off. Otherwise, it was a good place to sleep.

Text: The hotel was clean and the suites are very roomy. Front desk staff was excellent and very welcoming. The bartender was less personable but the drinks were good.

Text: Fantastic service! The building has an old times feel to it on the outside but well presented inside. The overall stay with complimentary breakfast topped off a great overnight stay!

Text: Room was great, can tell it's an older hotel, but for the price you can't beat it. Restaurant at the hotel was real tasty too - highly recommend the crab crusted tilapia
