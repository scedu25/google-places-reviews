Text: I just spoke with the hotel manager on the phone trying to make reservations for a date this summer.  They had openings for all but one of the days that I needed.  The manager was so nice to help me book the nights that were available, offered to book the room for me for the missing night if something became available and even offered to call her sister hotel in Independence to hold a room for me for the extra night in case nothing opens up.  She was very personable and wonderfully accommodating.  I don't usually write online reviews but I have to speak up about such outstanding personal customer service!  Thanks again!

Text: They have the tvs blocked for the HDMIs. No amenities and breakfast is all bread and yogurt. I dont like it at all. I'm here just for work and theres nothing to do around the area. My coworker had his please do not disturb sign and they still went in.
