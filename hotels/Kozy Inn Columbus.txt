Text: It was absoutley horrible. The beds are not comfortable at all we were awake all night and when we woke up in the morning we had massive bites all over and they refused to do anything about it. Wouldn't even give us our money back I do not recommend at all!!

Text: I use book it  app to reserve the room. Upon my arrival, when I gave my information, it was as if I just walked in off the streets. So once I went back over my needs for the room. I used cash therefore it was a $25 deposit. Which was totally okay, I get my room key, enter the room, there was holes in the blanket and chairs. It was very outdated and dirty. I took pictures of the room right away. Even the coffee maker was not worth touching. I had to go spend money to make it comfortable to stay overnight. In the morning when getting the deposit back, I told the man at front desk, I had pictures of the room, he quickly handed over the cash. And turned his back to me. Next time I will spend 30 more bucks for a better hotel. I didn't see bedbugs, but it would not surprise me to learn they have them.
