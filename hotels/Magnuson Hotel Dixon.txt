Text: It's a little run down but I feel safe and the owner was very accomodating.  If you book online and have special requests (I needed a crib and adjoining rooms) you need to call them and tell them the requests because they don't see them until you check in.

Text: This is a nice motel for the money. The bed was comfortable and very clean.  The room was clean and large had a table and couch, which was also comfortable. You can tell the new owners are trying to fix the motel back to its newer days. This is an older complex but nice.  The front desk was very pleasant  I will let stay here again next time I'm here on business. April  21 2017

Text: A favorable review for a hotel that has a great location. The rooms are meet and tidy, good beds and the price is the best around. The only recommendation from me is to remodel the bathrooms.
