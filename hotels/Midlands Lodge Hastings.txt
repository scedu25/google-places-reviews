Text: Horrible service and horrible rooms, the owner is completely rid rude and definitely needs to workon his customer service. Wi-Fi connection only works outside the room. Only good thing about this dump is the cleaning ladies are extremely nice

Text: They are the truest example of a budget motel,  but the room was clean, the Wi-Fi worked, the air conditioning was cold, and the shower was strong and hot.  Not sure what else one would want in a night stay during a drive through the state.
