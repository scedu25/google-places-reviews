Oakwood Resort

Text: Upon arrival, we were taken aback by how beautiful this place was. Check in was such a pleasant experience because the staff was beyond friendly. Once we got to our room, we were amazed at how tastefully done and clean it was. I have to mention the bed as well... SOOO comfy! 
The fire pits (wood provided) were such a nice touch, the views were spectacular and the food at the restaurant was beyond amazing!
We were sad to leave and seriously considered just moving in.

Text: We sat outside overlooking the lake on a perfect afternoon. The waiter who tended our table was helpful and attentive. The menu had plenty of options that all sounded excellent. One of us ordered a burger, another the seared tuna tacos, and a third and myself ordered the jumbalaya. It was a generous portion and absolutely delicious (and nicely on the spicy side). We didn't order any drinks as it was a work lunch, but the atmosphere, service, and food could accommodate about any occasion. Highly recommended.

Text: My husband and I went to Oakwood for a wedding, reception, and then took spend the night. The wedding and reception were beautiful. The room was brightly painted, with four poster beds that were comfortable. We went to the restaurant for lunch when we got there and breakfast the following morning. The food was quite good, especially the breakfast buffet with an omelet, crepe, and pancake station. The only problem we had was the maids woke my husband up early by making a lot of noise in the hall.
