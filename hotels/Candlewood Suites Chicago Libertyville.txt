Candlewood Suites Chicago/Libertyville

Text: Great value for the money! Don't come in here expecting luxurious accompaniments as you'd get in a high end hotel. What you will get is a hotel that provides you with a number of basic essentials, making it perfect for those trying to avoid excessive dining out and spending. The gym is actually surprisingly good...the best I've seen so far in a hotel. There are free weights (dumbbells up to 50 lbs), multiple treadmills, a bench and a fantastic cable machine with a number of attachments. The cleaning staff is absolutely wonderful and the front desk is helpful. My only minor qualm is that the location isn't necessarily the greatest in terms of access to local shopping.

Text: We were not in our room very long, but it was very nice. We stayed in the extended stay so we had a nice kitchenette. The rooms were clean and cozy. I loved that they had things to rent, like crock pots, board games, and blenders. I would stay there again.

Text: Very nice place. Cheap rooms for long term stays. Small kitchen for people with long term stays. Quiet. Customer service is really good, the girl at the front desk was really nice. I feel pretty cozy.

Text: Excellent staff, affordable, very clean. What more could you ask for? I had never heard of the Candlewood brand prior to my stay and I was very impressed. Next time I'm traveling I will look for the nearest Candlewood.
