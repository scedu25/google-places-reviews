Text: Went to look at the one they had available, Was greeted by a gentleman that was upset because the one that we were supposed to see was already taken. Out of all three property's this was the one we liked best.Management needs to communicate more effectively and needs to be stated on website that homes are not yet available so people do not waste their time. Very upsetting because we like the property.
