Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Columbus Airport East, OH

Text: The hotel is currently under construction. The parking lot is tore up, and the main office has been relocated. The new rooms are gorgeous, and it will be a fantastic location when the renovations are done. The rooms have a very modern feel to them. We stayed in a double queen suite which had 2 televisions and a sofa lounge. There was enough storage for a long stay, and the hotel offers plenty of amenities; pool, hot tub, fitness center.

Text: Old smelly place. Ongoing construction and renovation to improve the place. I arrived ten minutes early and the room wasn't ready for another hour and a half. I arrived early to study for a class at OSU. Construction was supposed to end at 6:00 PM. It's almost 6:30 and they are still nailing siding on the outside of my room. Pretty much a waisted day of traveling and studying. There are a lot better places to stay for the money. I won't be back.

Text: Very clean and well kept. The girl at the front desk was pleasant and helpful. And the rooms were easy to find. Also had treats (cookies) out for guests at any time. Will definitely stat here again

Text: I stayed here one night. The receptionists were friendly and efficient. The room was clean though there are no frills. The breakfast is typical of what one can expect of hotels. 
I secured a pretty good deal on priceline. I wouldn't have paid more than the discounted price for this room.

Text: Horrible experience.  Renovations are going on and the place is a mess.  One coke machine and it was empty by 6:30.  Room was hot and I couldn't get it cool enough for me.  No place to work as a group in a general area.  I am supposed to stay two nights but I don't think I can.  Absolutely the worst place I have ever stayed.  Stay away!!!!
