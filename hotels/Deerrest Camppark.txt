Text: I called today to see about getting a permanent camp site at their park, the lady said, and I quote, I turn down 2 or 3 a week so its not even a possibility, period.  I asked her if there was a waiting list, answer was no.  My question is if someone gives up their site, then what?  Wait for someone like me to call and then they get a site?  Crazy!
