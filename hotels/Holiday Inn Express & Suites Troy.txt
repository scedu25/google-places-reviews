Holiday Inn Express & Suites Troy
Rating: 4
Text: Great location in Troy near shopping and restaurants. Good customer service. Stayed for two nights. The first night the room has a strong ammonia smell and they placed us in the wrong room. They were sold out and unable to move us but gave us a small credit to our bill. The next morning they switched us into the correct room and again gave us a credit for our inconvenience. No noticable changes for being there as part of a VIP party. I'd recommend it and stay there again.

Text: Clean rooms. Small rooms. Double Queen room was still small. Pool was small but we'll take care of. Great popcorn. Breakfast was well prepared and timely. Overall wonderful stay.

Text: Very home feel. Breakfast is provided. There is a public pool area, and some suites have a bathtub/shower/jacuzzi. My suite was relatively clean, and visual areas were well kept (but I did check under the bed, and it needs a vacuum). Slow elevator, take the stairs. Would definitely stay at this location again.

Text: Not too bad of a place room was pretty clean and kept up. The breakfast menu is getting pretty boring for those who are in and out of hotel's daily like myself. Hotel needs to be updated as far as the decor is concern.
