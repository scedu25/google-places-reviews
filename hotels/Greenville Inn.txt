Text: YUK!!! We we just stayed there last night to go to the fair. I will NOT go back to stay again. Where to start... so my  wife and I have bites all over are selves after waking up. I was supposed to be in a room with 2 
Queen beds, but they were actually full-size. The carpet looks like 1970s disco. Even though it was a smoke free room the entire building smelled of cigarette smoke, also the ad that I read online said it had free breakfast and we can stay there a few years ago and they did have free breakfast at that time however they do not do that anymore as well. The water pressure in our room would barely not the soap off of you. I really could go on anon but I definitely do not recommend this place.

Text: A horrible experience!   We were moved to 3 different rooms in 12 hours.  The first room had bedbugs.  The second room had a filthy floor and no water in the toilet.  We were told there would be a rate adjustment and they credited us $11.   Do NOT stay here!  This place should be shut down by the Board of Health.
