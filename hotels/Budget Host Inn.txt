Budget Host Inn
Rating: 5
Text: We were getting gas across the street and at that point, we'd been on the road for 14 hours so our 2 year old was already over that scene. I didn't think there'd be another hotel for a while so even though it looked a bit rough on the outside, we decided to stay. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were very affordable so I wasn't expecting much. The food was just cereal but luckily we brought plenty of our own snacks and there's a Dairy Queen next door. The room itself was a little outdated but very clean. It didn't smell bad, there were no bed bugs, the beds were comfortable and the room was spacious (and also included a mini fridge and a microwave). Honestly, I've paid more for rooms that looked worse so this was a nice little surprise. I would definitely stay again.

Text: This motel was clean, comfortable and reasonably priced; I spent one night, while passing through town.  I would stay there again, as well as recommend it to others.

Text: Pros: Decent price, typical budget hotel, ample parking, staff was friendly, beds and room were clean and there are no bedbugs.

Cons: Deadbolt wasn't working correctly, refrigerator and microwave and basically everything that required a lot of power was plugged into the same power strip (why?) causing the power to trip. Room was a little shoddy overall.

Text: Very convenient.  Right near the interstate, but not any real traffic noise.  Plain, no frills, but it is clean and the staff is very accomodating.  I would stay here again.
