Mariann Travel Inn Scottsburg

Text: It's making me give the star. GROSS! The outside of the building and pool are quite deceiving. So outdated, everything was stained, chairs were torn. Lots of hotel chairs outside by rooms. People sitting out all night. Bugs just hanging out. Stuff poured down the walls. Bathroom tile falling off. I could go on. I would not recommend or stay there again.

Text: Room was fine, beds comfortable, clean, carpet new. Bathroom was not in as good of shape, tiny soap bars, no shampoo, small towels. Breakfast was poor. But, the price was quite low.

Text: Not too good, lady checking me in didn't even work there, no outlets.  Bathroom was dirty, behind the beds was nasty.  Was a place to sleep that's about it. Only gets 2 stars for being sleepable.

Text: Place is older but in very good condition. Pool is outside, well maintained. Previous night my stay was in a chain hotel, the shower did not work there .  The stay at Mariann Travel Inn was much appreciated after that. Thanks
