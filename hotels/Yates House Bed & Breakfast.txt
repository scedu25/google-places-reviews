Text: I am having an amazing time at the Yates House B and B with my wife. We came directly from our wedding and Conrad and Dixie have been incredibly accommodating. Breakfast was spectacular. We could not be happier.

Text: This was an excellent b and b. We have never stayed in one of this quality. The hosts were congenial and very interesting people

Text: to be fair, this review would have been given at least a 1 star better without receiving an inadvertently misplaced email that discouraged feedback. At this point I would recommend NOT going back expecially the Wildflower House "suite". I will be forwarding my email correspondence to my credit card company.  NOT HAPPY

Text: Amazing to say the least! The room and the property both are immaculate! The two-course breakfast everyday was also incredibly delicious. Dixie and Conrad are delightful hosts. And Yates House is right off the Katy Trail. It doesn't get more convenient than this.
