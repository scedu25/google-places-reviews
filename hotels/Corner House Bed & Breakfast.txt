Text: It's been a long time since I visited Karen and the Corner House, but from the reviews I can tell she is still the best around.  I loved staying at the Corner House both times I visited Nicholasville.  Karen was the best hostess ever and the accommodations both times were fantastic.  Highly recommended place to put down for the week while you enjoy the area.

Text: We had a wonderful experience. Our room was very clean. The bathroom was spacious. It was quiet (even on a Friday night). No weird smells. No cigarette smell. No bugs (I checked). The breakfast was very good, homemade, and filling. The owner was friendly.
