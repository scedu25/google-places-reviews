Candlewood Suites Polaris

Text: I thoroughly enjoyed staying here. It was nice to walk over to Texas Roadhouse to grab a bite to eat - the discount with showing the room key and specials from 4p-6p were other excellent perks. The staff were all courteous, kind, informative, helpful and welcoming. The beds were the most comfortable I had ever slept in at a hotel. The rooms were nice, the pool was a nice perk and being close to a major highway was convenient.

Text: The up front appearance of the rooms are very nice. Beds are comfortable. We had a suite with a seperate bedroom that had no airflow into the room if the door was closed. Also if you look at the corners in the bathrooms they desperately need to be cleaned. The living space also needs a good dusting for everything eye level and above.

Text: You get what you pay for. Location is excellent, but the good stops there. This hotel is beyond mediocre, and you shouldn't expect non smoking here at all. The entire floor is non smoking and the smoke smell knocks you over at all hours. Walls paper thin, and since its most economical hotel in the area the clientele is less than desirable. Don't waste your money here, I should've known when it was the only hotel in the area with availability on all my needed nights. Not up to normal IHG standards.
