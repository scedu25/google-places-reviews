Peculiar Park Place
Rating: 4
Text: Very nice & helpful, friendly staff. We are in a shaded section of the park which we appreciate because it is away from traffic noise. However it is disappointing that they advertise that all sites are full hookup. They are not. We even received a park brochure when checking in that makes this claim. But we have only water & electric. So, looks like my hope of avoiding a dump station is up in smoke. We still like it & will stay here again. Wish they would be truthful in their claims.

Text: Quiet, affordable campground.  Nice!
A bit of a downside:  Cash or check only.  No sewer on some sites.   But good bang for the buck.
