Text: Nice service, clean room, and within walking distance to a theater and food. I just wish they would have a detachable shower head as their fixed one is a little low. Otherwise, i had a great stay.

Text: Our room was supposed to be non-smoking but clearly wasn't. Over priced. If the rate isn't below $70 I would go somewhere else. The pictures don't do it justice, it really is just a super 8. Abysmal breakfast that reminds you that your life sucks. I regret staying here, and I wish we had just slept over night in my truck.
