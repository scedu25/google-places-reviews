Eclectic boutique hotel in the heart of Ohio Street. 
Old Chicago building so don't expect Holiday Inn sized rooms. 
Eatery and Bar in the lobby and a Starbucks just across the street. 
Comfortable bed and rain shower made for a nice stay. 
Neat and useful that they put Amazon Echos in the room with their own ACME skill too.This place is awesome. 
Won't stay anywhere else in Chicago! 
Cool rooms, super clean, outstanding staff! 
Have the coolest amenities like free coffee  delivery, Alexa in your room, awesome hot tub! 
And they are super adorable! 
Highly recommend you don't waste your time going anywhere else but here!
If you're looking for a hotel with a lot of personality, convenience and great service, this is it! 
The room had a funky retro rockabilly feel to it but still managed to remain unpretentious. 
Staff was very helpful and concierge was great! 
The only negative I found was a handful of cheerios under an auto man and a large bug of some sort that escaped before I could see what it was! 
Cute boutique hotel in a good location with rooms that were nice and clean. 
The staff was friendly. 
I agree with those that said the counter space was non-existent in the bathroom, particularly for 3 people. 
They could also use better and more lighting. 
Start by putting a better light bulb in the entty to room 1408.This hotel was great! 
Friendly, helpful staff really showed and was the cherry on top. 
Little touches like rock music in the elevator, a guide on the TV (which had a really nice full HD picture), decorative art everywhere, creative door covers a for the ice machine, exits, and elevators, Alexa in the room, and second floor lounge also made our stay enjoyable.This was a great location for a weekend trip to Chicago.  
Nice area for walking.  
Friendly staff. 
The pump room bar was a nice landing spot after a long drive.  
Lots of people hanging around and chatting. 
The room was great and quiet.  
Valet parking deals with your car.From the perspective of a first-time Chicago visitor, this place was pretty great. 
It's clean, well-maintained, and reasonably affordable. 
It's a couple blocks from the L which will take you downtown. 
It's a slight jog over to the lake, which has access under the highway to a running trail. 
It is also a moderate walk (just being honest) or short Uber to some really popular restaurants and shopping. 
The concierge was great, there's a bar on the first floor that serves GOOD coffee in the morning (no, not complimentary). 
A good time was had by all.
What a great place! 
The area of the location (Gold Coast) is so nice, clean, and safe! 
Given our first visit to Chicago, we were impressed. 
You can walk to all the popular places in 20-30 min. 
The room in the hotel was small but enjoyable. 
The inside is glamorous and very welcoming. 
Overnight parking is around $60 a night so beware!
This hotel is so overhyped and overpriced! 
The rooms are dark and small and the view to the back is hideous. 
The wall-to-wall carpeting is disgusting. 
The only thing fancy is the accent lighting and the bath products. 
The bed is only ok level comfortable. 
Also, the shower is impossible to figure out. 
Would not recommend.I was in town for the Chicago marathon. 
The Ambassador is positioned in an attractive area North of downtown with access to numerous transit options. 
The lobby had an interesting decor: modern amenities juxtaposed with classic architecture.Decent,  have petsPlace is ran down We had a whole crew stay here for a week and the staff was super helpful.  
They worked with us best they could with short notice and ave is a great rate on the room.  
Will definetly stay here again.I wish i could give this place a big fat "0", bad service and no blankets!!!!!! 
all we had on the bed was a top/bottom sheet. 
When asked about blanket or spread they said non was available. 
The breakfast was BAD! 
The  only hot food sausage and gravy looked like it was in the pot for a day or so. 
I paid $75 through priceline! 
RIP OFF! 
Express deal. 2 and half stars. beware.Zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Someone please burn this hotel down!!! 
Not familiar with the Chicago area and decided to find a hotel at reasonable price for the night around 99.00 a night!!  
Baymont Hotel is the worse hotel ever and in a really bad neighborhood  so beware!!! 
First off the room was hot air condition broke , mattress had blood stains all over it, bathroom dirty, walls very dirty, sheets dirty. 
We tried three different rooms and all was horrible!!! 
They refused  to issue a refund due to no refund policy. 
The pictures  of the hotel was very misleading!!! 
My guest and I took a loss and left hours after booking the hotel. 
We didn't even unpack our clothes and relax  before we ran out of the place. 
My advice never check into a hotel like this without looking at the rooms first before u sign anything. 
Health department seriously need to shut this building down NOW!!!!
I wish I could give this place 0 Stars. 
Don't stay here. 
I've stayed at this location several times for work. 
Most the time it smells heavily of Marijuana. 
This last visit It took me 45 minutes to check in because I was assigned to the wrong room. 
Then because of this issue I was given a "random" room check phone call at 4am.Never staying here again and no neither will anyone from my company. 
Please. . . 
Choose another.Friendly and helpful staff. 
Great hotel for the price. 
Convenient location!
As a family of 5, we go to Bengtson's every year, and every year we fall more in love with it! 
It's so fun, not only for the kids, but the adults as well. 
Do everything they have to offer, it's completely worth the money! 
This year we went on a day that had a little rain, and it was 2 hours before closing. 
There was practically No one there, which is AWESOME for us because no long lines to wait in for rides!!! 
So much fun! 
So glad we have this family tradition!!! 
Thanks Bengtson's!
The first time I visited Bengtson�s Pumpkin Farm, I was 11 years old and visiting with my Girl Scout troop. 
I still remember the hayride to the pumpkin patch; which has since evolved to a much longer, more leisurely hayride. 
Now more than 15 years later, I have enjoyed visiting the farm annually with my own children. 
I live for the moments of pure joy my children feel while at the farm and am so blessed to have captured many of those moments in pictures. 
I swear you can hear the laughter coming straight out of the pictures. 
Bengtson�s is so well kept and maintained; it offers plenty of fun for all ages and needs. 
The staff members are truly the cream of the crop! 
If you have not been, it is definitely a place you�ll need to add to your list BUT BEWARE...you�ll never be able to just go once. 
It is sure to become a family favorite and like ours, a tradition. ??
This place is awesome! 
I was here for like 3 hours and wasn't bored at all. 
There's so much to do here it was like six flags all over again! 
I would definitely come again. 
Everything is free except the food and drinks of course and that only $2-$5. 
They also had tacos pizza and BBQ. 
Not sure how much that was because we had ate earlier but it's nice to have a bunch of options. 
It was my first time and I had a blast. 
Also I'm 24 and brought my 2 friends, there was no kids with us and we still had a fun time.We are the ultimate Pumpkin Farm Junkies, we had gone to all the Wisconsin pumpkin farms and just wanted something different so after some google searching, we discovered Bengtson's and decided to try it out! 
After driving 2 hrs, we loved every second! 
The drive from WI was great too different scenery! 
My kids (5&10) both enjoyed it! 
Worth every penny- pictures are simply amazing with the background and such a great family friendly environment! 
Tons to do: animated characters, races, hay ride, corn pit rides, etc! 
Food prices are very reasonable for a family budget! 
Rides are unlimited, with  your entry ticket! 
We are def going to make this trip again!  
I 100% recommend this farm, if you haven't gone- don't miss out, you wont regret it! 
(p.s. they have the cleanest potter johns I've ever seen- always a plus in my book! 
?)
I took my girls here on opening day of this year, my daughter's had such a blast! 
It wasn't busy and we got to go on the rides many times and the employees were so friendly and because it wasn't so busy of lines they let the children stay on the ride to go on again! 
Very kind! 
The new cow ride omg it was a blast, I even loved it and I'm 30 :-) we went on that many times. 
The corn pit is so nice! 
I loved the lights inside, and the fact they had stairs to go inside of it, so much safer in my opinion. 
I love also, how you can sit on the edge if you want with your feet in the corn pit as you watch the kids. 
The food and drinks are at a good reasonable price! 
Medium size drink was like 2.50 that's a good price I'm my opinion. 
Their are many many things you can so their. 
For sure an all day thing! 
I'm totally taking them back again soon. 
Also it was nice having two train rides Now, especially when usually the train one is always long. 
So yeah I am so happy and excited for new things they did! 
So much fun!!!! 
???
The rooms are clean. 
The staff is helpful and friendly. 
Many employees seem to genuinely care about the guests. 
The breakfast is much better than most hotels and the rates are reasonable. 
If I am in this area again, I will definitely stay at this hotel. 
The only thing I don't care for is the location. 
It is on a service road along side the expressway and there is nothing around it. 
It just seems like an odd spot for a hotel.Dear Manager of Best Western Southland ,I am sadly not impressed with this hotel. 
I have 3 complaints and these are major that need to get fixed as soon as possible. 
First The girl with the lip piercing and marijuana bag your housekeeper , serviced me nicely in my face , not knowing I understood Spanish BUT cause I am a Caucasian woman thought I didnt. 
Told one of your other housekeepers , the one with the BLACK long hair , skinny. 
That I was an "ugly" etc. 
And that I expected her to do S*** for me. 
That is most disrespectful and i expected better from these housekeepers. 
I would like you to handle this with her first and foremost. 
Second of all Sara my front desk assistant also thought I didn't understand and decided to talk about me to the other woman with the lip piercing . 
I dont like these under trained children working at this company . 
You need to get either A mature adults or B qualified and respectful workers. 
And finally my bedsheets were all dirty and not changed properly . 
There's was garbage shoved behind the MINI fridge. 
You need to hire a better housekeeping supervisor or fix it. 
Lastly you guys don't drain the pool all the way nor clean the hot tub fully . 
The breakfast made was chunky waffle mix that you guys made was not mixed well and not cleaned out. 
The bathroom was leaking.  
The Jacuzzi was broken.  
Thank you . 
I hope you learn from this review. 
And improve .Room was in poor condition mechanically. 
Broken slide lock, loose toilet seat, plugins were loose and didn't work on bedside lamp. 
Cleanliness was also an issue. 
Hairpin on floor, ice bucket not cleaned, bed cover looked dirty. 
Windowsill was also very dirty. 
One day a member of the cleaning staff left her spray bottle behind. 
Food ran out 30 minutes before breakfast time was over. 
The one bright spot was front desk staff were very friendly. 
Check in and out went smoothly. 
We were also offered a discount on our stay for the trouble which was appreciated.The BW Chicago Southland is a nice, clean place to stay.  
I stay here strictly for work purposes only.  
I'd like to see a tv in the fitness room and have it open 24 hrs as I am up early and the facility is not open.  
Good breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms, and a nice place to stay.This hotel has improved drastically. 
Comfortable rooms, microwave and refridgerator, breakfast, the staff, and the hotel was amazing.Very nice hotel for the price! 
Great day time employee/owner. 
Nice clean rooms with a great breakfast. 
If you stay awhile the employees start learning your names and become so friendly! 
We were very happy with our stay and definitely recommend this hotel!
Location is descent. 
Food is nearby, right off the main road running through Merriville. 
Rooms are small and a little on the low end side. 
Service is good, very nice front desk. 
No problems with service. 
Just have to upgrade and remodel a bit to make it up to date.Hotel was a little difficult to find but was conveniently close to the interstate. 
At check in, the woman at the desk didn�t really know what she was doing but was nice. 
At check out, the man was very helpful and had great customer service.The five start rating is for the hotel staff, mainly the woman named Carmen who works there. 
She totally saved my butt when I stupidly only booked 3 nights when I needed 4. 
She was so nice and totally understood my mistake and helped me out of my bind like it was no big deal. 
She deserves a raise. 
As for the hotel, it is nice as well. 
Decent breakfast in the morning, it has a fitness area, outside pool and free wifi. 
What more do you need? 
Seriously though, give that woman a raise. 
Will be staying here again.Pool was filthy and liner is old & wrinkled. 
Found rib bones with tons of ants around it on the pool deck. 
Pool is supposed to be heated, but was cold to me. 
Staff came to pool while I was in it and scolded me for not using pool towels outside. 
I had wrapped some of my room towels around me to go to the pool& was going to use them. 
Rates have been drastically increased. 
New management! 
Manager is only concerned about making money. 
He is never there. 
Others are running it in his absence. 
I had to argue to keep my regular rate. 
It took 4 phone calls. 
After my arrival, I asked if there would be a problem next visit with my rate. 
Basically, I was told only if they were not busy. 
I have a disability and need to use the whirlpool, jetted, tub. 
Previous owner graciously gave me a discount. 
New Manager was called and actually called me from his cell & said he would honor the rate. 
The man at the hotel argued with me about it for several minutes. 
Finally, he agreed to the rate for this time only. 
I have never had such a difficult time. 
Their King bed room is $20 more than the one by the interstate. 
There is nothing around them. 
They only have a small outdoor pool & no hot tub. 
The one by the interstate has a huge indoor pool with a hot tub by it. 
May have been my last stay. 
Really disappointed. 
I am a regular long time customer.This is a nice, no frills hotel. 
It's a 15 minute walk to Soldier Field , Field Museum and Sheds Aquarium. 
It's also walking distance to lots of good restaurants. 
Rooms are clean. 
My bed was comfy. 
With 2 double beds the room the room felt a little cramped but it is by no means a deal breaker. 
The room prices were the best I could find for a decent hotel downtown. 
There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. 
There is a small coffee maker in the bathroom which I did not use. 
There is a small bar and cafe downstairs. 
There is a Starbucks a block or two away. 
The staff was really friendly and helpful. 
I would definitely stay here again.We enjoyed a lake view room for one night at the Best Western, and had a great stay. 
Our lake view was truly that, overlooking Grant Park and the lake. 
The staff were friendly during check in, the room was clean, and the hotel looks recently remodeled. 
Comfy bed, big bathroom, great water pressure, etc. 
Comfortable and got a good night's rest. 
Did not use their parking or restaurant.I  have stayed here 2 X this summer and both time was treated wonderfully.  
Very nice rooms . 
Very close to all the sites. 
I  thank you for such a wonderful experience in Chicago. 
The staff seem to make you feel like family. 
I will be back. ??
Our stay here was very positive. 
The staff was very professional and informative. 
Our room was very contemporary and newly remodeled.  
The location was wonderful to access our destination. 
A great value for downtown Chicago.This hotel has an incredible price for the location. 
Finding close parking was a bit of an issue, but that's to be expected with downtown Chicago. 
The front desk staff were always super friendly. 
The building and rooms where pretty standard, nothing special.Such a beautiful ceremony! 
The banquet hall did an amazing job! 
Staff was on point all night! 
Bartender was very efficient! 
Service was excellent every step of the way!
Gurdie is rude... management doesnt return calls... room had no toilet paper only a few towels and smelled weird... rooms numbers were written on notebook paper and taped to the door.... ice machine was old and rusty... my room door was open when I got there maintenance needed to finish putting in filters in some of the rooms... coffee maker but no cups... shower pressure low... soap bars very small... needed new towels and bath mats those were very thin and had hairs in them still... shower still had some hair in itWe stayed here before flying to San Diego for our honeymoon because it was the most cost effective sleep & fly package I could find...next time I will spring for the more expensive option. 
We had to be given a different room right away because the key card lock was not working. 
We found roaches in our bathroom in the middle of the night. 
Breakfast was of very questionable quality. 
I'm giving two stars because the staff were really friendly and helped as much as they could, but I'd say just opt for something else.Horrible customer service!! 
We booked and got a hotel room and put our baggage in it and then when we came back there were OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR ROOM WITH ALL OUR STUFF IN IT!! 
And they made us change rooms instead of telling them to get out of the room. 
Now we have a flight to catch and they won�t recompensate us for their horrible services! 
The manger is also very rude and will not respond to Expedia or Best Western Corporate.For the money, I've been very satisfied. 
The staff is courteous and helpful, and have responded quickly to my needs. 
I'd rate it higher, but the building is being renovated. 
The transition has created almost no inconvenience, but it would be dishonest to compare it equally to a building not being renovated. 
I gave it 4 stars more on principle than dissatisfaction.This hotel was fine. 
It was nice to have meat and eggs at breakfast every morning. 
I had no problems with the wifi. 
It is near many other hotels. 
The staff was friendly and helpful. 
This hotel met my expectations for the price point. 
I give them three out of five stars because it wasn't quite as clean as higher priced hotels I have stayed with.From first welcome, to final checkout the staff and management at this property demonstrate a level of customer service much appreciated, but not frequently enough experienced at other locations.  
It is obvious from the manicured exterior, to the professional appearance and demeanor of staff, to the cleanliness of the rooms, to the presentation of the breakfast items that the aim of management and staff is complete customer satisfaction.  
Located conveniently off major traffic arteries, this property is also close to shopping and restaurants and proves to be a comfortable and reasonably priced stop over.  
Don't hesitate to stay there.Great staff.  
Clean rooms. 
Truck parking made easy.  
Good restaurants close by.  
Lets not forget pool and hot tubI will never go back to this Hotel again, Boiler broken no hot water on Saturday couldn't go swimmingSunday no coffee made at continental breakfast.They wanted to send us to another hotel just to take a shower  but who want to take their clothes from one place to another. 
We decided to microwave  us some hot water .They did offer any compensation but they took all our money. 
They could have offer to buy us lunch!!! 
. 
We was they for a girls retreat  but instead it was like one of their staff member said you guys paid to be in prison and no one cared. 
God has away of  letting you know they is no place like home. 
A  Saturday with no hot water paid for in full I could have stay home were the hot water was fine.I had car trouble a couple blocks away and was having it fixed nearby. 
The staff was so helpful the next morning, giving me and my baggage a ride to the autoshop when I needed it! 
And the accommodations were very nice too.Booked months ahead on Expedia for a excellent price. 
Just off exit 5 on 1-94, but winding road with no street lights to get back to it off main street. 
Check in was slow as it was that time of early evening. 
Room was clean, spacious, good working order of electronics, lamps, coffee maker, microwave and fridge.Bed was comfortable. 
Staff very helpful in telling how to get to places of interest. 
Breakfast was extremely good. 
Hot eggs and meats made everyday with a variety of cereals, waffles, muffins, breads, etc.After a 12-hour stay at the nearby casino my boyfriend and I were exhausted and didn't really want to drive back to Chicago. 
We found a Motel 6 that was our original destination but when I noticed a Best Western next door we immediately changed our minds!  
I'm glad we did!  
From the moment we entered their lobby I knew we made the right choice!  
Their front desk staff has service with a smile! 
He was really friendly and courteous!  
I couldn't expect more with the room -- comfy bed (and pillows) clean carpeting and housekeeping even checked in on us to see if we needed any additional services or items!!! 
This was by far the best hotel stay I've had this year!  
There's no doubt in my mind I'll be back!
Staff is very helpful and friendly. 
Clean rooms, towels were a little thread bare. 
Spacious room. 
Free breakfast was very good.There's only one washer that HALF the time works (if you sit on it). 
Also the front desk has a woman who is very RUDE to customers. 
She ALWAYS has to argue or 'correct' you if she thinks you're wrong. 
And always has an attitude. 
I'd give no stars if I could. 
DEFINITELY needs improvement on customer service skills and better maintenance on your laundry services.Megan and kyle are exceptional service staff. 
They did a awesome job of making my stay as comfortable as possible even though i had a few issues with my own company. 
They stayed patient and worked with me on everythingLocation, location, location! 
If you're going to a Cubs game and staying in Chicago, this is the place to stay. 
While it seems a little over-priced for what you are getting, the location makes up for it. 
It is under a 10 minute walk to Wrigley Field. 
When we weren't at the Cubs game, we were a 10 minute walk to the water. 
Spectacular water front and park system. 
We were also just a 30 minute bus ride into Chicago and the Navy Pier. 
There are local bike rentals and an excellent bike trail that goes for miles. 
The room was clean, but nothing exceptional. 
They have a nice patio out front to eat breakfast or have a morning coffee. 
The hot breakfast was really good and varied but the area where you get breakfast is small. 
If you pick a popular time to eat breakfast, you might be disappointed, as the room can only hold 4 people max. 
Bed was comfortable, the Internet was fast and overall it was a pleasant experience.We had a very nice king room with Jacuzzi. 
Well maintained & clean. 
Staff was professional and helpful. 
The free breakfast is great with awesome cinnamon rolls & coffee.Our party of nine stayed in two suites. 
Rooms were both roomy and fairly clean. 
Breakfast was great. 
We went to two Cubs games and were able to walk to both games. 
Neighborhood seemed very safe. 
Parking was extra but right next to the hotel and was inside/covered. 
Staff was friendly. 
Location was the big draw to stay at this hotel.The staff was nice but the hallway had holes in the wall, our room had holes in the wall a broken light and no outlet near the beds. 
And for being in Chicago in the cold fall we wanted a hotel with a nice hot tub. 
But it was broken every day we were there.This hotel is very clean and comfortable. 
Lovely, diverse residential neighborhood. 
We walked to local restaurants and to Wrigley field. 
Quick Lyft rides to Navy Pier and all museums. 
Enjoyed our stay very much. 
Hotel was also very quiet, never heard noise from anyone.Fantastic value for a prime location in Chicago. 
Walking distance to many major attractions and the inside was recently renovated. 
Nice clean carpets, new paint and comfy beds. 
Exterior still looks old and is in early stages on updates. 
Was not disturbed by noise and the staff especially the concierge were very nice. 
If you want a clean comfy spot in the heart of the city and don't want to bust your budget I would recommend a stay.This hotel was wonderful. 
The rooms were clean and spacious, staff was friendly and helpful and the location was perfect for exploring the shops and going to the Chicago Theater (all walking distance). 
We traveled with our children (ages 7 and 11) and they loved the pool.  
The staff went out of their way to make them feel welcome and gave us great tips for planning our weekend.  
We would definitely stay here again.Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff. 
The restaurant connected to the hotel is great as well. 
Good food and service. 
We've been here multiple times and each time is a great experience. 
Location is very convenient for restaurants and shopping.Excellent property in the heart of Chicago. 
Just a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and the heart of Chicago river.  
There is a Chicago Trolley/Big Bus stop right by the hotel. 
Many great restaurants and local markets nearby.  
If you want to hear authentic Chicago blues, Blue Chicago is literally right next door to the hotel!  
Great music!!  
Hotel staff were extremely helpful and accommodating!  
Plan on staying here again during next visit to Chicago.Love this hotel.  
Will stay no where else in Chicago. 
Check in and check out was so easy.  
Price for in the city was great.  
Staff is awesome.  
Allowed early check in and held our bags after check out so we could enjoy almost two full extra days in the city.  
Pool was great.  
View from pool was awesome.  
Room service available, quick and fast and good.  
Staff is willing to help and give directions to where ever you needed to go. 
Suite was huge, bed was comfy.  
Housekeeping was great.  
Just an overall great experience.  
A++Stayed here 2 nights. 
I was very happy to be given a room really early on the day of my check-in. 
The room was nice and clean, very comfortable and well lit. 
The bathroom was kind of small but very functional. 
Perhaps the best parts of this hotel are its location and the terrific people who work for it! 
I'm definitely hoping to be back here if I'm in the area. 
Thanks so much for an awesome stay.My wife and I stayed here for a conference she was attending. 
The staff was friendly and helpful. 
The room was clean, but curiously designed, as we had to step up a couple stairs to go from the sleeping area to the closet and bathroom area. 
The bed was comfortable. 
Breakfast was good for hotel food, but the location, only a short walk from the stores and restaurants of Michigan Ave., was perfect.Stayed for one night. 
We arrived early on a cool and rainy day. 
It was so nice that the desk clerk waived the early check in fee. 
The staff we all very friendly and helpful. 
The room was spacious and clean.We loved out stay at Cambria Hotel & Suites - Chicago Magnificent Mile. 
The room and facilities were great. 
The staff was friendly. 
The location was perfect to the mile. 
We were able to access everything we wanted by walking. 
We would stay again.If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.  
com Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...I stayed here after attending a friend's wedding. 
I was very happy with my stay. 
The beds are super comfy! 
They are currently renovating rooms. 
We were in a room that wasn't renovated, but it was still very nice. 
Great water pressure, good toiletries, nice windows, and again super comfy bed! 
The rooftop is really nice too so I recommend checking it out!
Room was mostly clean and in order. 
Coffee machine in room looked greasy and was left full of water from the previous Tennant. 
Coke zero in pantry had expired 6mi ago.Bed was comfortable. 
Location is great. 
TV is good.This is a nice place to stay. 
I love the kitchenette in the rooms and the gazebo with gas grills. 
It is a good place for socializing with other guests. 
Rooms were clean and staff was friendly. 
Not a bad place to stay for an extended time.The baseboards in the room were never cleaned, and our room smelled of mildew. 
Wasn't too bad once your nose adjusted to it though. 
Staff was nice and friendly which is always a plus.Here on reservations made by a friend of the family. 
Fairly nice hotel, but one issue. 
Our air conditioning unit has mildewed. 
Aside from that, not badI recently stayed at the Candlewood in Merrillville, IN. 
Sadly, I was traveling for my father's funeral. 
They knew this (as I was probably crying when I made the reservation), they actually called me while I was on my way driving out of state to find out my estimated time of arrival. 
They wanted to make sure my room was available and ready prior to my arrival. 
The manager and staff were so kind and considerate. 
Even one of the cleaning ladies gave her condolences as I was getting onto the elevator one day.  
Thank you for all of your efforts to make my stay enjoyable given the circumstances.I also need to point out that they gave me a free upgrade to a full suite since the hotel was sold out due to outside events in the area. 
The rooms were very clean, well kept, and very well up-to-date. 
If given the opportunity, I will most certainly stay here again and will refer friends and family to you.  
Thank you again! 
Caleb Tolleson 1507211497Very restful! 
I'm impressed with their food service. 
Family friendly, and there's so many different outdoor activities. 
The lake, basketball, soccer, gaga ball, and 9 square! 
Asim Kamal 1507778016This is a campground with nice cottages and a very open clean air feel. 
Staff is very courteous and friendly. 
There are many activities, a lake, playground, basketball, volleyball and many cottages for all sorts of needs and guests. 
Regina Stovall 1499082921Beautiful place, welcoming staff. 
My grandson has attended the day camp four yrs in a row, he looks forward to it every year. 
Linda Garcia 1502079662So peaceful and the people here are great! 
Roohi Younus 1508521664Loved this place!
Mostly good. 
Room was pretty small but wasn't too cramped. 
We had to wait over 10 minutes for them to get us another pillow. 
When I asked for ear plugs at night they said they would send some up but when the guy came he only had a "sleep kit" which had a face mask, some tea, and a smelly oil, no ear plugs. 
Otherwise service was very good everyone was nice and professional.The room was nice and clean. 
Lots of little details that made our stay comfortable, like silverware and plates in room, microwave, as well as the free bottled water. 
The attached restaurant was delicious and room service attentive.  
Definitely worth what we paidIf you're on a business trip, this would be an ideal hotel for affordable prices. 
For a short weekend getaway this may not be the best option as everything around it is the financial district area. 
So weekend everything is closed. 
No fridge in the hotel room is a deal breaker for young families with babiesLocation is really great, close to everything you'll need. 
You can easily take the subway, rent a bike or even go walking to whatever place you want to visit. 
Our room was clean, the size was acceptable and there was a pretty complete kitchen in there. 
The Wi-Fi was not good though, there was no safe box in the room, the hotel does not offer breakfast and the lady who told us this was not kind. 
Fortunately, you�ll find a Corner Bakery pretty close to the hotel, which offers great stuff for your breakfast for a pretty decent price. 
Despite the mentioned lady, the hotel staff are friendly and the hotel is good.The staff was very friendly and very helpful. 
Check in was super fast. 
Room was a little outdated, but very clean. 
Bathroom was very clean as well. 
Bed was comfy, room was a good size. 
Would definitely recommend this place to stay. 
A quick walk to different shops and restaurants. 
Will for sure be staying here again. 
The issue people might have with this place is their expectations. 
This is a hostel, not a hotel. 
For a hostel, it is fine. 
A nice neighborhood but with plenty of food options within walking distance. 
The rooms aren't anything too special but they do the job! 
I paid $66 a night for a private room with a bunk bed in it and that's all I needed, no more, no less. 
Free breakfast was appreciated too. 
The only issue is that the bathrooms are shared but they weren't particularly disgusting or anything. 
Keep in mind that this place always has lots of guests who are all using the facilities throughout the day. 
Honestly the place is great for the price. 
Just understand what you're getting into. 
Maybe bring an extra pillow if you need more than 1 since my room only came with 1 pillow per bed.The hostel is located in a very nice upscale residential neighborhood. 
Free breakfast is included which consists of waffles, cereal, coffee and fruit. 
Lobby and dining room has modern furniture. 
Free computer use and printing by the main desk. 
Pool table costs $1. 
The community kitchen is quite large and includes all the cookware and supplies you could possibly need. 
There is community shelving for food and large fridges and freezers for guest storage. 
A few vending machines are located behind the kitchen. 
The patio looked great, spacious. 
Bike rentals are available for $15 for 3 hours or $20 for the day. 
Popcorn was available in the lobby. 
Laundry machines in the basement. 
Room was basic and clean. 
Shared bathroom included stalls and locked showers inside private stalls. 
One hairdryer in the bathroom.Nice place, historical, cozy, multicultural. 
You can bring your own food and cooking there. 
Nice seating and relaxing area. 
The beds can be improved. 
More blankets in the rooms and a deep clean in the bathrooms. 
Close to everything in town, you can walk and they have a parking available.   
Going back again...Beautiful building. 
Scary Shining like hallway, but fun if you know what I mean. 
Staff is excellent. 
Great knowledge of the area. 
Great suggestions on what to do.I am here now and I will definitely return. 
It is home away from home. 
People are friendly, personnel is experienced and good. 
Bathrooms are located a little bit far from our room, but they are clean and spact enough. 
There were toilet stuff to share like shampoo etc. 
In the evenings you can share a room with others and chat and play guitar or pool, or you can work with the computer. 
Bikes are available for rent at a good cost. 
Breakfast is good and we walked to Cloud gate by foot, so it is not far. 
I strongly recommend it!
$50/night valet mandated parking or $40/trip at the nearest lot...so we were told (didn't confirm) was a bit steep imo. 
The valet were prompt, cordial, and available 24hrs.The room was clean and comfortable. 
The bathroom was a nice size and clean as well. 
We had a corner room which overlooked the parking lot and forced us to keep our blinds closed or give the neighbors an easy view. 
The business room was quaint, but easily accessible and quiet. 
They have a shuttle service and the driver was great. 
Very personable and altered his route to bring us closer to our location (it was raining). 
Ultimately, I would book this location again, although I would probably skip bringing my car there.First and foremost, my biggest piece of advice if you stay at this hotel is to call the local police if there is illegal drug activity and audible violent altercations on your floor.  
We called security 3 times to address this exact situation as we tried to get sleep for our sick loved one in the hospital across the street.  
Nothing happened, so if you'd like something done and you'd like to sleep, call the local police.Second, expect a lack of flexibility, empathy, and respect from most of the front desk employees/managers.  
If you'd interested in an absence of security for your physical safety but an abundance of security for your Marriotts rewards points, this is the place for you.  
One plus- the bartenders were very kind.Staff was friendly and helpful. 
Rooms were clean. 
Toilet ran until jiggling the handle, but otherwise everything was in working order. 
Location was great for our conference at the UIC Forum. 
Would recommend.If you are attending an event at the United Center this is the perfect place to stay. 
They offer free shuttle service to and from the event. 
The hotel was nice either a large bathroom. 
The breakfast was very good but a little pricy but that may be typical for the city I'm not sure. 
I would stay here again if going to the United Center.Expensive but very nice. 
The front desk staff was extremely helpful. 
The only weird thing was the restaurant. 
My husband went to get a Starbucks drink but it wasn't really a Starbucks drink. 
Something on the machine quit working and the drink ended up being half of whatever it was supposed to be but he was still charged the full amount. 
I will say, tho, they id try to make up for it the next day.This is a great hotel. 
It had one of the largest gyms I have seen in a hotel in awhile. 
Come on, they have battle ropes, in a hotel gym. 
The service is good and find are pretty big. 
Everything is clean and well maintained. 
You can't ask for more in a hotel, and if you did I'm sure they would oblige you.Friendly staff and fully renovated hotel. 
The amenities that include the club lounge to the gym were amazing based on the location and legacy of the hotel. 
The gym was about the size of one floor of the hotel which was great to see.I attended a conference here.  
The rooms were clean.  
The staff was quiet but friendly.  
The food was good.  
Water, tea, and coffee were always available.Rooms are nicely redecorated, but it's an old building and windows are not well sealed. 
So even on a high floor street noise is very evident (and there's a lot of it). 
Also, elevator noise could be clearly heard, even though I was three rooms away. 
Also, AC unit was noisy and rattled. 
Not a place for a light sleeper. 
First room I was given had no hot water. 
It seems incredible that the hotel would not be aware of this, did they think guests wouldn't notice? 
I called down and they said they would send maintenance up. 
Didn't happen for a while and I had a meeting, so had to take a cold shower. 
Then the maintenance guy showed up, confirmed the problem and left. 
Later when I came back, nothing had been done, so I called back down and finally was given another room. 
Staff were trying their best, I think. 
Every member of staff that I dealt with was friendly and helpful (except for that maintenance guy).No specific problems, but the room was in a state of needing some attention.  
The grout around the shower valve was gone so it was flapping off the wall and letting the water run inside.  
The fabric of the desk chair was ripped as well.  
There were very few accessible outlets and no USB connection.  
Not what I expect in 2017.  
However, things were clean.This hostel is ok. 
It's cheap and is located near the Willis Tower. 
You can easily reach downtown Chicago by foot. 
The staff is friendly, too and the breakfast which is included in the price is totally fine. 
The cutlery and coffee cups could be cleaner. 
It is also not very cool that it isn't possible to lock the toilet doors and that the toilets and showers are in one room. 
But if you only stay there at night it's ok.Not very clean. 
Super thin walls. 
I couldn't sleep because of the noise from the bar three floors below. 
No individual control over air conditioning. 
Over-priced and they charge for everything. 
They even charged $2 to watch my bag for a couple hours. 
I'm glad it was only two nights.Good location and price. 
However, the two single bed room I booked had a couple Maintanence issues, including 2 electrical sockets with exposed wiring, the walls and ceiling are looking a little worse for wear, with some water and physical damage. 
The first floor women's showers did appear to have a mold issue. 
That said, I did enjoy my stay and would stay again.The rooms are roomy! 
The breakfast is free! 
The showers are very nice! 
The Parthenon Hostel is the whole package. 
Highly satisfied.Worst hostel ever. 
Unfriendly staffs and misleading room sizes from description. 
On top of that, they have only one Men's toilet for an entire floor. 
There is always a queue in front of the toilet. 
What an horrible experience for a group! 
Breakfast is so poor as well. 
You can get a cheap hotel with more amenities at the same price. 
Feeling so regretfulPretty good stay. 
It's a 3 star hotel so there are some cosmetic and function flaws (dresser drawers and closet doors that don't slide open or closed smoothly and a room door on which the deadbolt requires a trick to work) but the staff was friendly and helpful. 
Bonnie (front desk) and Jesse (maintenance) were sweethearts, easily changing my room when I declined the one with the trick deadbolt. 
I loved the room they moved me to. 
Plenty of space. 
The hotel is within walking distance of McCormick Place where the conference I was attending was being held. 
Even better it had free parking!
My one major complaint is that the cleaning staff isn't terribly thorough or especially good. 
Nothing was left dirty just less than neat. 
They left one of my pillows on the floor after my first night there. 
I didn't realize I'd knocked it off and apparently neither did they. 
And on another day they didn't replace the towels until evening when I was back in the room and the lady was knocking as she used her key to come in the room. 
Just really glad I was fully clothed. 
I'd stay here again but it would be dependent on the price and how close it was to where I needed to be.Nice hotel, good beds, big bathroom and the tub is huge. 
Seems like a decent area, but I'm in town for an event, so I haven't gotten out much. 
Few blocks from an L stop that takes you to the north loop, so pretty convenient! 
There's a few parking areas, first come first serve. 
I checked in early, so there were plenty of available spots but it could fill up quickly.Awesome! 
Loved the large rooms with refrigerators included. 
Beautiful large bathrooms. 
Front desk people very nice!  
I liked it better than the Crown Plaza. 
Some in my group did not like the parking situation which is an open lot.  
Lobby nice too.Great hotel! 
Loved the remodel. 
Front desk was awesome and friendly. 
Perfect location for our visit. 
Free gated parking in back.The people who work here were nice. 
They were good with turn down service. 
The drinks at their bar were well priced. 
My only knock is having to ask for extra face rags. 
Two people should get more two rags a piece. 
That and their "private" lot gate wasn't properly functioning when I arrived (they have a gated and more open lot; must have their parking pass to park in either).All good other than.My friend and I visited Chicago to tour a film school, and when researching hotels before our trip we found Chinatown Hotel to meet all our requirements while still being quite cheap. 
When we arrived we were not disappointed, everything was what we expected or better and the location of the hotel was perfect too. 5/5 would recommend.Decent location. 
Easy access to trains and only a few stops from downtown. 
Rooms were outdated, had very few features (TV with a couple of channels and A/C) and far from cozy. 
The building is older so there is no elevator, which after a long day of walking was rough. 
I would stay there again if I couldn't find a deal downtown again.Great place to stay. 
The rooms are small. 
If you are looking to stay in your room for your entire visit them it might be a problem. 
Otherwise its close to lots of things. 
The room was clean and bathroom clean. 
There is no elevator so if you are on the 3 rd floor its 3 flights of stairs. 
The staff is very nice and helpful.Looks better than expected and the rooms are rather comfortable. 
Although the constant siren might be a slight annoyance at night. 
All in all, location was the key of my choice.Cheap and affordable. 
Great location in heart of Chinatown with close proximity to public transportation. 
Very basic amenities but helpful and friendly staff.We paid $250 for a Saturday night. 
Not worth it! 
The hotel was very noisy - sitting right next to the Train and with thin walls we could hear walking above and laughing and shouting into the night from next door. 
The decor is very plain - robot monkey and train theme. 
Drab grey. 
Bathroom door would not close. 
Worth the $78 for a week night but not worth over $100.PROS: Two rooms with a couch, historic building, proximity.Nice room, plenty of space. 
Staff seemed friendly. 
Bedding and towels were clean, as was the room. 
Beds were nice and comfy, pillows we're in good condition. 
In room refreshments seemed to be reasonably priced. 
Rooms had soaps, shampoos, and lotion included. 
Only downside was the enterance. 
It just didn't feel very classy - felt like it was underground. 
I would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend.The worst night ever in a hotel! 
The air conditioners were very noisy. 
Every train stopping at the Belmont station was loud enough to wake me. 
And I was awoken in the middle of the night to discover that I had many (40-50 ) bug bites all over my body. 
The room apparently was infested. 
But don't worry, a brief visit to Urgent Care doctor and I am on the mend. 
Though at the moment I just was to rip my skin off.Pros: Cozy, comfortable, close to the L, tons of awesome food spots within walking distance, great neighborhood, nice people.Cons: noisy air conditioners (but actually probably not much of a con as they drown out the street, train and other guest noise) laggy TV, so it probably should be a pro.)Positives: Location is great -- easy walk to Wrigley, and right by a transit/train stop. 
The rooms are nicely sized, and the place definitely has a historic feel and some charming retro details. 
Nice afternoon snack setup and light breakfast offered free daily. 
Multiple excellent food options in the neighborhood. 
Negatives: The radiators are very loud, clanking, woke us up a lot. 
Ended up turning the dial to turn them all the way off, but that wouldn't be an option in the middle of winter. 
The floors are also very creaky and there seems to be virtually no soundproofing between floors. 
Our upstairs neighbors for the first two nights paced and paced and paced -- including in the middle of the night and very early in the morning (3-4am), making it difficult to get solid blocks of restful sleep. 
The final night we were there, a new couple moved in upstairs and while there could be no doubt when they were having sex, at least it was a reasonable time  and they went to sleep afterwards, so we got some sleep finally. 
Between the rads and the floors, we were pretty tired when we left. 
However, I did not hear noise from outside the building, nor from the very nearby train. 
I would probably stay here again, if I could be assured of a top-floor room. 
This hotel was clean, comfortable and had a kind and attentive staff.  
Go there.  
It's awesome!  
They care about their customers.We were a little skeptic at first...don't be! 
This is a super clean hotel with great service! 
Liz and Bryan were super nice! 
The breakfast was amazing! 
Not your regular (Holiday Inn, La Quinta...etc) out of a bag into the microwave breakfast. 
They had meat,(thick bacon, not thin and microwaved) eggs, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, pastries... 
The pool is simple and has a cute slide located in the somewhat center of the hotel. 
The pool could be right out your back door if you choose. 
The price is very reasonable! 
The restaurant definitely gets ***** as well! 
Hat's off to the chef! 
The only thing I could say that was a little inconvenient was the smaller bathrooms, but it doesn't stop us from coming back!! 
Great Job Clarion Inn owner/staff keep up the good work and lower prices!
The rooms were very clean. 
The restaurant has excellent. 
The breakfast they served is one of the best offered by a hotel.Good overall dining experience.. 
A little wait for service. 
But over all experience. 
GoodComfortable just didn't like the room service foodThis hotel is perfectly located in downtown Chicago within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. 
It was easy to find. 
The staff was very accommodating. 
The first night there was a slight buzzing noise in our room that we determined was the mini fridge. 
Since we didn't need the fridge they sent maintenance up to unplug it for us. 
We did not at first have enough wash cloths for two people in the room, but they brought us up some upon request. 
There was coffee in our room, but each morning we took advantage of the lounge's coffee, tea, fruit and granola bars. 
In the afternoon there was soda, candy and various trail mixes available. 
The bed in our room wasn't the most comfortable but was fine for two nights. 
We also really appreciated the complimentary bottled water stations on each floor. 
Overall, especially considering the price, we were extremely happy with out stay here and would definitely return.Excellent hotel downtown on the river. 
It's conveniently located in downtown Chicago with great rooms and a great staff. 
There is a restaurant in the hotel and everything is nearby. 
You also have a view of the river in some rooms. 
Definitely recommend for anyone in Chicago.Great location. 
Rooms are relatively small, but is enough.  
Good service.  
Water filling stations on the floors for bottled water.  
Clean and comfortable beds.The staff here is the best!! 
Nice free snack bar. 
I will say don't love the beds there a little hard but other wise fabulousRooms were well furnished and comfortable, front desk was wonderful and helpful, restaurant service could have been better, valet was a bit understaffedAlthough I've stayed here before, this last visit was by far the best! 
The room we had was very spacious, including the bathroom. 
The bathrooms are usually just big enough to accommodate each guest. 
This one was big enough to sleep in if necessary. 
Plus it was not a handicap room!
Great staff who were accommodating, warm and not to mention the fastest check-in we�ve had at any hotel or motel. 
The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was great with delicious and surprising additions to the standard Comfort Inn/SuitesIt was actually really good for the price even though we had four people and I ended up sleeping on a chair I still thought it was good. 
They had breakfast too Wich was pretty alright. 
Overall would recommend.Was in a good location. 
The breakfest in the am was very good. 
Pretty quiet at night and good customer service.Great location. 
Very clean. 
Breakfast bar always serviced. 
Staff very friendly and helpful. 
Room serviced daily.One of the nicest and well-constructed Comfort Inns that we have stayed in recently. 
Notice the seal on the door in the picture to help make the place quiet. 
In addition to the standard eggs and sausage this location also had biscuits and gravy.Comfortable and clean room. 
Good hot breakfast. 
Friendly staff. 
Be careful if you use the pool area as the tile there is VERY slippery. 
Not sure why it's not textured... it seems like it would be a liability. 
We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel. 
Clean. 
Helpful/Friendly. 
And a yummy breakfast tooThe hotel was sleek and modern. 
The rooms were big and spacious with modern decor. 
The beds are super comfy. 
Has a clean feeling environment. 
I would definitely recommend. 
Only thing was the town surrounding smelled like cow ploppies.Fantastic and cheap place to stay if you are driving through this place. 
During our countrywide roadtrip this turned out to be one of the nicest places. 
Clean cozy rooms and good breakfast !
It was really nice! 
I had my son's birthday party there. 
It was a pool party. 
They were under construction or remodel but they were super great I couldn't use the breakfast room for cake and pizza so they let us use the pool room as long as we cleaned up after ourselves and one of the guys doing the remodel gave my son five bucks for his birthday which was really nice of him. 
Super great stay and I'd do it again! 
Awesome!
Concerned at first because of the carpet debris thrown into parking lot and in front of building, but they are just remodeling and making effort to improve the place. 
Kids enjoyed clean pool, breakfast was fully stocked even with a lot of guest checked in, quiet rooms BUT THERE IS A TRAIN TRACK so be prepared for train noise. 
We would stay here again.Comfort Suites was perfect for my needs. 
The rooms were large (had 2 queen beds and a pullout couch) and clean. 
It was close to the casino and just off the highway. 
I was helped in a very friendly manner and they were very hospitable. 
They also have a very nice pool and hot tub.Easy location to get in and out to I-29.Good breakfast.Helpful and cheerful staff.Good value for the price.Nice rooms, decent pool area. 
We stayed in a double bed suite and it was clean and comfortable. 
Friendly, accommodating staff. 
Good selection for the free hot breakfast. 
Workout room was cramped, but did have a treadmill, elliptical, and free weights. 
Jennifer P 1505844122Nice motel, friendly owner. 
Reasonable price. 
Close to everything you would need!! 
Joseph Sherck 1497153853This motel is exactly what you would expect at the price and location. 
It's mostly to serve the truck stop next door. 
But, the sheets, toilet, and tub were clean. 
That's about all you can ask for at these joints. 
Also, front desk clerk was very nice. 
Lots of TV channels to drown out the sex from next door, which would be louder if the walls weren't cinder blocks. 
Jeff L 1502980727Nice Motel nice people reasonable prices close to anything you need Earl Paone 1500900427Everything is disgusting,  I was actually glad I had my own blanket because I refused to sleep on those blankets!   
The office style chair is absolutely atrocious and stain riddled.   
Most of the switches in the room don't work.   
The vent in the bathroom didn't work.   
Refused to shower without flip flops on due to the mold riddled tub and needed to shower with the curtain open because the curtain was stained everywhere. 
Paula Hall 1501187456They could clean the rooms a little better, check the faucets to maje sure that the hot water is working in the sinkGo here if you want to have the most stressful time you've ever had at a hotel. 
They steal your money, over charge and then lie about it. 
Watch out for the stuck up 2 faced lying hotel manager. 
They charge your card, take the money out and then tell you it's being "held".  
They accused me and my family (2 adults and a child in the room) of smoking marijuana multiple times even after being told it was not us. 
Stayed for 3 weeks and I have never seen so many disgruntled customers in my life. never staying again and I will always tell people not to go there.Super friendly staff. 
Very quiet, well appointed room.   
Nice, but very small pool. 
Good to splash in. 
Free breakfast - sausages, biscuits and gravy and waffles for hot food, assortment of cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins as well as a variety of drinks.Would definitely stay here again.I came into town to attend the last practice at the Bears' training camp. 
I chose this hotel for my weekend stay because of its proximity to the camp. 
I got in late (after 11 PM). 
I didn't particularly care for the employee that checked me in. 
When I asked a question, her answer was very snippy. 
Didn't sit right with me at first, but then I shrugged it off. 
However, the treatment I received from the two front desk employees the next day was nothing short of spectacular. 
The manager allowed me to extend my checkout by an hour, which I desperately needed. 
That was very much appreciated! 
Additionally, when my Uber was late to pick me up, I arrived 4-5 minutes past my checkout time. 
I was in freakout mode thinking the hotel was going to require me to pay for another night in order to retrieve my belongings from the room (that is how it is done at most hotels). 
This was not the case! 
The young man at the front desk said that was not necessary. 
He reprogrammed the key for me! 
I never leave reviews, but I just had to commend these two employees for accommodating me as much as possible! 
I would stay here again, for sure. 
I gave it 4/5 stars because of the first employee I interacted with. 
Wasn't a big fan.I can honestly say this has been one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.  
Would not recommend it to anyone, ever.  
Highly recommend not drinking anything they offer as every time myself and my friend that were there found stuff in our drinks especially the coffee with green fibers coming out of the pots.  
The manager refused to talk to us over several issues that we had the few days we were there, and the entire staff was very rude about anything that you would need to ask about.  
Cleaning staff didn't even attempt to clean the rooms as I found dirt in hair in the bathroom on the first night before using anything.  
I wanted them to come in the second night and the same thing didn't even add toilet paper.  
Myself and my friend ended up leaving early and switching to a different Hotel down in Bourbonnais. 
It was absolutely terrible.  
Twice a year about 30 of us use this hotel to stay at...we do a collection show at the will county fairgrounds.  
We got there Saturday late afternoon and went for supper around 5.  
Back at 8...we sat outside having coctails and enjoying each others company.   
At 915 the desk lady came out and said we had to go.    
We were all ok with it and started to move to our rooms.   
Nobody was out of hand or loud by any means.   15 min later a police car showed up then another and another.   
Told us the front desk lady had called and said we were loud and wild...my jaw about hit the floor.   
Well we went to our rooms but I went back to my vehicle about 10 min later.   
There was still a officer outside.   
We chatted some and he said he sat and wat he'd us for 15 min before they confronted us.   
He said he seen nothing wrong with what we were doing.   
UNREAL.       
Come to find out the people that were there the night before we're loud and crazy sitting in our same spots ....the guy slipped the lady $100 and another $100 to the lady who came in for the night shift.     
It was ok then.     
They thought we would do the same for them.   
NOT.         
We have been staying there 2 times a year for close to 10 years.   
Not any more.     
So next time u want to stay at this motel...make sure u don't sit outside and enjoy the evening without slipping them some cash.    
UNREAL.My family has stayed at this hotel many times over the last 2 or 3 years.  
It has become our go to hotel when we are in the area.  
We stayed there this past weekend and we were very disappointed to know that our favorite manager Ms. 
Tracey as we called her, was no longer working there.  
She always made my family feel welcomed.  
Our last visit may have been our last visit to this hotel because of some of the bad experiences that  occurred during our stay.   
The night manager was not very sympathetic  to our concerns about the plumbing issues, she offered to bring me up a plunger when the toilet overflowed!  
Really???  
once she came up with the plunger we still had to request that someone clean up the toilet water.  
her response "let me see if I can find someone"....shortly after that someone came up to clean up the water with towels....the floor was NEVER mopped! 
I know it was 2:00 am but I think they could have at least brought in some kind of sanitizer.Nice staff but, the hotel needs updating. 
There were also stains on the drapes and one small stain on the bed spread. 
Other than that my stay was pleasant.Initially, my husband and I were stressed because it was the only place with an available room and it was more than we intended to spend. 
However, the wonderful service provided to us by the front desk clerk, Desiree, made the whole occasion worthwhile. 
She was kind and friendly and she went above and beyond! 
The room was also delightful, very clean and nice. 
We forgot to mention non-smoking, so we did get out in the smoking section, but we really couldn't tell! 
There was little to no smell of smoke. 
It was incredibly comfortable, which is hard to find when travelling away from home. 
Overall, we were highly satisfied with our stay, and are likely to stay again in the future.I would give them a 1/2 star if possible. 
Only good thing was the coffee. 
They have dirty, disgusting rooms. 
I booked for a 3 week stay and this is what was in the room: dirty carpets(not vaccumed), hair in the bathroom on the floor and shower, coke or blood looking drips on the bathroom floor, trash on the floor between the beds and deodorant stick smashed on the floor next to bed, ac unit broken(ac stays on set at 64 degrees). 
I told the front desk and their solution is switch me room. 
Okay so I�m on my new room and still unvaccumed carpets, hair in the bathroom, and trash not dumped from previous occupants. 
Totally a dump here, they need to fire the cleaning people and hire someone who cares about their job. 
Very disappointing, also the lobby had a under construction sign which I�m sure is older than a year because there was NO construction going on and obviously everyone complains of dirty rooms, so maybe they just want to keep the sign out there so it�s a good excuse. 
Don�t stay here, spend the extra money for another hotel!!!
Staff and cleanliness was excellent !!! 
However the pool was way too high in chlorine and was burning our eyes just being in pool area. 
It reacted our sinuses as well. 
Other than fixing that everything else was fantastic. 
Just wish my kids and I were able to have some pool side fun.Absolutely wonderful place to stay. 
We went down for our sons navy graduation. 
The staff is unbelievably kind and accommodating. 
They changed our room twice for us no extra charge, gave us extra blankets, made sure we were happy with the change, our son left his phone in the room when we're changing rooms and they called me when we were at lunch and told me they charged it up and that it would be at the front desk whenever we got back. 
Love, love this place and the staff. 
Oh yeah... the free chocolate chip cookies all day were awesome as well!!!! 
Thank you so much for the great experience.It was nice to stay there. 
Room was clean and  fresh.  
Indoor pool and hot tub was nice?. 
But no lights in either. 
The wasn't comfortable for me and my wife. 
I would have gave it four stars. 
Breakfast was ok. 
I expected some kind of meat for breakfast, sausages or bacon, but they did serve bacon and scrambled eggs the day we checked out. 
Free breakfast 6-9:30am. 
The area has lots of things to do. 
Mall, restaurants , stores, gas stations, pretty much everything within a 10 mile radius. 
We went to Steak and Shake and order Mindy's barbecue which was very good, brought it back to the room,  matter of fact we went to Texas Roadhouse which is on the same property. 
Its a nice place to stay for couple of days.Stayed here while in town for a wedding.  
The room was fine.  
Staff wasn't the best with passing along information or giving me the gift bag that was left for me by the wedding hosts.  
It's also weird and inconvenient that there's only vending/ice on the 1st floor.   
Inconvenient at check out b/c "system was down" and they couldn't print my receipt, but I did receive it by email.  
Management did contact promptly regarding my feedback.  
For the price, I would pay the extra $20 and stay next door at the Hilton :/Had my wedding block booked here. 
Had agreed on one price with contract then when guests called to reserve if 2 people were in a room they were being charged an additional $10 which was not agreed appon. 
Had to call and give each guests name affected individually to get fixed. 
Then another guest called and they said there were no rooms available. 
But when I called on there behalf they suddenly found one. 
Overall not the best experience for my wedding.This place sucks, was rated as a 3 star hotel on price line, lucky if it would rate as a 2 star.  
Shame on you Price Line, you have lost a 25 years loyal customer.  
Back to this crapy hotel, it seems like the gal at the front was more concerned about feeding her face and playing games one computer.  
I'm actually thinking about checking our now and going to a hotel that cares about their customers.  
Stay away from this dump.Awesome stay! 
Hotel staff were amazing. 
Bartender was fantastic (is it just me or does he remind you of Jess from Gilmore Girls?)! 
Trusted him with making me whatever drink he wanted and I didn't regret it. 
Prompt service. 
Housekeeping did an excellent job. 
Laura at the front desk was always so helpful. 
Will definitely stay here again!
Really nice hotel�heard they recently did some renovations. 
If this is true, it paid off! 
Within walking distance of many great restaurants and the staff is very nice! 
Can't go wrong here.Wonderful hotel and even better location.  
The staff was very helpful and friendly.  
We had a  king room with fold out couch.  
The couch was twin size and we were expecting at least a double.  
My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   
Pool was small but nice.  
I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  
Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. 
Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  
I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  
The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  
Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  
Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!
I was there for a training for work.  
The customer service is wonderful.  
They took extra time to help my co-worker and I store our luggage and seamlessly recognized us when it was time to pick it back up. 
The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. 
I will definitely be staying there again soon. 
This hotel was a block off of Michigan Avenue but it felt like it was on Michigan Avenue. 
This allowed for a slightly lower price than some places on Michigan Ave. 
The location of this hotel is absolutely superb for shopping and restaurants. 
It was right next to Burberry and all of the fabulous stores that Michigan Avenue. 
There was construction going on but it didnt bother us. 
The room was nice and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. 
Only complaint is that the hotel staff called us twice in the middle the night claiming that we ordered towels and telling us that they were on the way, but we had not ordered towels and we were just woken up from our sleep. 
Cannot stress enough how amazing of a location this hotel is in. 
The parking was $47 for 24 hours which was relatively cheap compared to $60-$70 valet at other places. 
It was self parking however so I recommend not moving your car until you are leaving the hotel or else you will have to pay multiple times. 
We will definitely be staying here again.Excellent location that is close to many bars and restaurants in River North. 
Valet service was a breeze, check in was easy. 
Rooms are clean, and quiet. 
Lots of city noise from outside, but the hotel is literally in the center of the city, so I used the complimentary ear buds and slept very well. 
Great stayI wouldn't go back to Chicago if you paid me, but this was a nice hotel. 
Very clean and professional. 
The sauna room was a bit of a mystery though. 
There was no way to put water on the coals and they appeared to be heated with electricity which is unnerving. 
Definitely need to fix that.They had a barbecue available and a great balcony near the pool if you wanted to use it for a birthday or something like that. 
I liked the pool even though it wasn't heated and i loved the hot tub which was freaking huge.All the hotels here are a rip off. 
Might as well go to one with a hot tub. 
That's what I think anyway. 
I was able to walk and uber to all the fun stuff.Staff was very nice and room was adequate as expected. 
Lost a star as we found a dirty diaper "under" one of the beds as we were checking out. 
Obviously didn't smell but if the room was cleaned before we got there plus between our stays, I can't help but question the thoroughness of basic cleaning. 
Other than that, was a good stay.Stayed here with two teenage boys while in town for a BULLS game.  
The staff was super friendly, the room was clean and comfortable.  
We didn't hear any city noise and we slept well. 
It is only two blocks from michigan ave and the street the hotel is on is full of restaurants and nightlife. 
I Would recommend!
My husband and I couldn't be more pleased with this Hotel. 
Great friendly service from the ladies at the check in desk, the house keepers,  the staff at the door, etc. 
They all made our staying great! 
When they knew that it was our anniversary all the staff around congratulated us and gave us a gift. 
Also, when we returned from the Rock and Roll Chicago half Marathon, we were received with a big Congratulation.The room was actually a good size for being Chicago and least but definitely not least... amazing location!
Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. 
Hotel was clean and check in was a breeze. 
Beds were super comfortable. 
Would definitely return again.I had a wonderful stay for nine nights. 
This place is a great secret. 
Great people. 
I have been to a lot of hotels and I have to say this is my favorite. 
They are there to help 24 hours.Friendly staff and updated atmosphere.  
Unique room set-up that made the room feel less like a standard hotel room.  
Local police are present as security, so feels safer than the typical hotel.  
Great location and friendly staff. 
Unfortunately, the room wasn't what i expected from a Courtyard. 
The carpet had multiple stains on it and the door to the closet was missing. 
It just seemed that the room should have been out of service until the room could be brought up to the standards one would expect of a Courtyard Marriott.Friendly staff and conveniently located. 
My room was a little noisy and I had a large flying beatle in the room so not a great night of sleep.Had my reservation 3 weeks before my stay. 
Because of traffic I arrived an hour after my check in time only to find out that my room was not ready. 
Still needed to be cleaned, which was done right away however the room was itself still dirty. 
The venue I was going to, if I ever go back I'll find a nicer place a bit further away.Nice service. 
Rough roomIt is decent. 
It's not like best western or something.FIRST OF ALL THE MAN WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE WHEN U CALL DOES NOT LIVE IN THE STATE, that was the 1st sentence the Lady in the office told us.  
My husband and I needed a place for a week stay, we walked in with our 18 month old son, the lady said she had one room for someone with a child (the other ones had new carpet or was recently  remodeled) she gives us a key and points across the drive for us to check it out. 
My husband opens the door and wouldn't even let us walk in! 
The smell of cigarette and old dirty sex just BLEW out of the room! 
DISGUSTING! 
Obviously we drove away. 
Don't waste ur time driving out to that *H#%hole. 
Mrs. 
Margo makes it worth staying here.My number one requirement for a hotel is that it be spotlessly clean which this was. 
It had some oddities, though. 
Room decor is on the plain side and a little dated but it actually suited my tastes, calm and relaxing. 
In  the bathroom where you would expect to find a hair dryer, there is a telephone! 
No hair dryer at all. 
No in-room coffee maker or microwave. 
Lovely plush bath towels but no hand towels or wash cloths! 
(Note: we later discovered the hair dryer on the far end of the shelf in the closet.  
If we hadn't noticed it by accident, we would never have thought to look there for it. 
When I asked the front desk about hand towels and wash cloths, the clerk said sorry they were behind on laundry, but they'd get the towels to us soon. 
We never did get any.)Our balcony looks over a roof area with lots of noisy AC units, but if you look out instead of down, the view is nice. 
The street looked really pretty last night in the rain. 
Parking is a drawback. 
You either park quite a distance and walk blocks to the hotel or pay a whopping $49 per day for valet. $49!
Crazy. 
Overall it's a good place and I would stay here again. 
Crowned Plaza ChicagoExcellent stay! 
My room was a little warm for my taste.  
But it was a great room. 
Erick checked me in and he is a great representative for your staff.  
After a long flight and a rough trip from the airport he made my day with his warm smile.  
The Crowne Plaza will be the go to for my trips to Chicago.  
And this is why in an UGH member.Honestly the best I've EVER slept in a hotel. 
Bed and pillow were very comfortable and it was quiet. 
I thought it would be really loud but you couldn't even hear the other guests in the hallway or rooms next door. 
Staff and valet were friendly and personable.The Crowne is still under construction, which means it's very difficult to get in and out of. 
The only option is valet parking and it's crazy busy. 
The staff also seemed a bit overwhelmed with how busy it was Saturday evening/night. 
Our first room we couldn't get into due to the key entry needing a new battery. 
And our second room was nice. 
Bathroom was small yet serviceable. 
Bed was fantastic and comfortable.The rooms could use a little updating, but this hotel is awesome overall. 
Great location, staff, and price. 
We have stayed here twice and both times they honored our request for a high floor room. 
This last time they gave us a top floor room and upgraded us to a suite for no apparent reason. 
They also let us check our bags when we arrived in the morning so we could go around without carrying our backpacks. 
Pretty great customer service.Senior mobile home park. 
Well kept. 
Takes RV for overnight, weekly or monthly. 
Quiet. 
No amenities Make sure you are in a smoking room if you smoke
.
  $250 Fine PLUS they will have the police wake you up at 4am and make you leave. 
The fine I understand. 
But being kicked out at 4am and a fine?! 
Yea, I'll NEVER stay here again. 
Plus bad customer service. 
Bathrooms are dirty.My company put me in this hotel for my 34hr reset, since I am a truck driver, My company did this for my comfort. 
Check out is 11am, I checked in at 5pm and was not supposed to leave until 1am. 
At 1pm I was told check out was 11 and please leave.I was putting up with the fact that the room was a smoking room and I am not a smoker. 
The room looked like it went under some reconstruction but not good at all.Well I told my company they might reconsider Days Inn for future use.The staff was very nice. 
(Hence the 1 star)The place is Infested with Roaches!!! 
We found 5 adult roaches and 2 baby roaches running around the bathroom and hotel room door!!! 
I used YoungLiving essential oils to spray the entire room. 
This is so disgusting!!!
Lovely staff. 
The room was very clean. 
It could use some updates and remodeling, or some fresh paint to life the place up a bit because it does feel old when you walk in. 
The do allow smoking in certain rooms. 
The bed was sooooooo comfy. 
My only complaint is that the hair dryer in our room was not working and there was a coffee maker without a pot ?. 
I look forward to staying here again next year.Clean hotel friendly staff limited breakfast but would stay again and recommend to anyone.shopping within 1 mileThe hotel staff was very friendly. 
No complimentary breakfast.  
The breakfast buffet was delicious and you get quite a bit for $11.99. 
They also give free warm and soft cookies..... on another note, they hold $50 per night. 
We kept seeing little brown ants in our room on the wall.  
I thought the price was too high due to not having a microwave or refrigerator in the room. 
The Evian bottle of water in the room is $4, so drink up if you want. 
Pillows are extremely soft. 
They do offer cots. 
Must wear wristband to get in pool.The room was amazing and closer to the highway than we expected. 
Staff and associates were helpful with directions and hospitality. 
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. 
Wish they had a microwave in room to re-warm cookies. 
But other than that, amazing stay!!!!
The on site restaurant was cozy even though they had a wedding going on. 
We sat in the bar. 
Service was slow that night, but the food was very good and worth the wait. 
We had the taco salad with chicken. 
All of us like it as an appetizer, then burgers. 
Definitely a nice time. 
I would go again.Hotel stay was comfortable. 
NOT at all happy with transportation from airport. 
Returned flight,, called hotel at 7:45 pm for "shuttles on the hour" only to find that it was going to be 50 minutes. 
Then I was asked if I was going to wait for it. 
I replied, what choice do I have, my car is in your parking lot. 
To which I was told that I could take a taxi. 
So, I spent another 40$ on a cab ride. 
Should be called park and get stranded.  
WORST park and fly experience ever. 
Stick to hotels because the transportation end sucks.My son's Wedding was held here...beautiful ceremony and beautiful room for the reception. .food was exceptional as was the wait help. ..I will look to hold any occasion at the Double Tree..I know they will give me excellent service.I'm not a picky person and this hotel was just fine. 
The location works well for me. 
There isn't a lot of heavy traffic in the area. 
Quick access to shopping if all sorts, including a mall. 
Friendly staff. 
Room was clean.Great service. 
Beautiful inside. 
Free WiFi. 
Close to the mall and friendly, beautiful neighborhood. 
Close the the lake. 
Easy to get around. 
Not far from Chicago. 
Good rail system. 
Restaurant had breakfast buffet, good food and great bar area. 
Lots of liquor and food options to choose from. 
Chicken Marsala was excellent! 
Clean rooms. 
Small bathroom. 
Great working space. 
Looked like adequate conference area. 
Very professional atmosphere. 
I feel safe and supported by staff and the accommodations.Quick check in, waited no more than 10 minutes. 
Very accommodating staff. 
Room was a double, what we asked for. 
Everything in the room worked. 
Maids could be a smidge more thorough. 
Over all, pretty good.Nice place to stay! 
Didn't have a king room our first night there so they said to call down to desk the next day and they would get us our king room. 
We planned to be gone all day so called the desk first thing the next morning and asked of it would be possible to change rooms since we wouldn't be here at check out time. 
She said no problem we have a king room available right now. 
Soon there was a knock on our door, front desk had brought us our new room key and even asked if we needed help moving! 
So really nice people! 
The downside was the tub didn't drain very well and our first room was too hot and our second room was just about too cold and we like it really really cold when we sleep so not sure what was up with that. 
You can change the fan speed in your room and not your temp just like others have said. 
All in all it was a place we looked forward to come back to at the end of the day.The location of the Doubketree was ideal for me as I was needing to to get the airport the following morning. 
The beds were comfortable, however the pillows, as seems to be standard with hotels, become flatter than pancakes within seconds of testing your head on them. 
The room service was great and super quick - great selections to choose from. 
The service was also decent - can't go beyond that as other than the chap that checked me in I didn't interact much with the staff.Stayed one night. 
Received a room with a dirty bathroom, but the lady at the front came to clean it so that was fine. 
The room I stayed in smelled weird and had holes in the ceiling, but the room next door where my mom stayed was much nicer.  
Overall, it's exactly what you'd expect from a Place looks sketchy from outside, however the rooms have been remodeled.  
It is $68 a night and I feel it should be a little cheaper for what you get.  
I'd say $50 a night would be a more fair price.Very run down! 
If your on the run! 
Lol, well it's perfect! 
No WiFi! 
It's just a place barely out of the rain!
Outside looked scary, but the inside was clean and the service was great. 
Bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water. 
If you're just looking for someplace cheap to pay your head, this is it.Just a place to stay! 
Personally I wouldn't want anyone I know to even think I would stay there.Like most Embassy Suites, view inside is great! 
Has full all you can eat breakfast in a comfortable atmosphere. 
The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. 
It's near the heart of downtown Chicago so lots to see within walking distance. 
For other sights, it's only a Uber call away. 
I recommend this hotel.The location is amazing. 
The room was very spacious, and they gave free ear plugs if you are not adjusted to City noise. 
Fantastic place.Stayed at this hotel for the Labour Day weekend - 3 night stay.  
Customer service at the front desk was terrible no matter who we talked to and the worst part was that the water pressure in the toilet was so low that the toilet wouldn't flush.  
We had maintenance come out twice to look at it but they never fixed it!  
Why pay $200+ a night to stay in a hotel where you can't even use your bathroom.  
Additionally, the hotel is literally right next door to a parking garage.  
It sounded like dump trucks were coming through all the time and we heard nothing but car sirens at all hours.  
When we asked to move rooms, they kept telling us they were full and to ask again tomorrow.  
Lastly, the lobby has a beautiful fountain...that smells like mold and dirty water.  
I definitely will not be staying at this hotel again and highly recommend staying at the Embassy Suites on magnificent mile instead.Our room was nice, clean, and well maintained. 
Zero view from our room but that was on purpose. 
If you want a view you are going to be in a room on a busy street with a lot of street noise. 
Our room was pretty quiet. 
Two complaints, the shower head was mounted neck high for me. 
It was on a hose which helped but still didn't like that. 
The other problem was the TV/satellite signal kept going in and out. 
This problem was not exclusive to our room. 
The breakfast bar was nothing special.Very great stay. 
The staff was helpful and upgraded my suite to a city view. 
Excellent service all around the hotel!
Six of us stayed there for our annual girls� weekend and we are not easy to please.  
The rooms were comfortable, spacious and the view of Lake Michigan was terrific.  
The service was top notch.  
A special thank you to Renee at the front desk who sent us a nice note with a bottle of wine and a plate of cheese.  
The location was excellent too.  
We would all highly recommend this hotel.We stayed in room 1015. 
It was exceptionally quiet. 
We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. 
Parking is confusing at first, but once you locate the Embassy entrance coming and going is easy. 
The pool was nice as well. 
The staff at the desk was helpful and friendly. 
We will stay here again. 
I would have preferred more water pressure in the shower, but it would not keep me from staying here. 
The pull out bed was comfortable for our son. 
We also loved the extra sink in the bedroom.The location is excellent. 
It is within walking distance to shops on Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park area. 
The staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were very clean. 
They have a great happy hour where you get 4 free drinks each night from 5 to 7pm and they have snacks out. 
They lost a star because they have satellite tv... which means when it's too windy or raining then you can't get any TV. 
Considering thus is Chicago and they are right by the river, that doesn't seem very smart.Small pool for hotel geared to families. 
Slippery floor in the kitchen area where you went to get your breakfast. 
We love the place. 
Great location. 
Great room / Suite. 
Breakfast was very good.. excellent mattress.Very convenient location, couple blocks from Michigan Ave shopping one way, about half mile from Navy Pier the other direction. 
Nice parking ramp and Whole Foods store across the street. 
Rooms are very spacious and clean. 
Great free breakfast. 
Stayed 2 nights with my family of 6. 
Just what we needed. 
My only tiny complaint was that while at breakfast, we were approached by someone trying to sell Hilton Honors program for discounted future stay rates. 
Maybe a good deal, but felt awkward. 
Donna Batdorff 1493669002I only spent one night in this campground but it was fine for my needs.  
It has a very peaceful lake and we had a spot overlooking it. 
Lots of area for walking the dogs. 
Water spiggots are high enough not to have to get on your knees to hook up. 
Garbage cans throughout the park, which was convenient.  
When I first called I didn't get a warm feeling from the woman on the phone, but when I got there the man was fine.  
I did find out that they have a dog weight limit of 15 pounds.  
We didn't get to that in our conversation until I was halfway through my reservation.  
They made an exception for me because I was just coming overnight, told her I'd arrive about 7, leave about 7 am and take the dog out once to potty in the evening and in the morning. 
She's a standard poodle and extremely well behaved and I actually have letters of recommendation for her from other places we've stayed just in case I run into issues with people not wanting to allow her. 
Anyway, they did make an exception, and it all worked out.  
It didn't look like there was a lot to do here, but that's the kind of campground I like, quiet with water. 
One thing I will warn about, the state road getting to their property is extremely bumpy, possibly the bumpiest road I've been on, and then their very long driveway is also very bumpy. 
Make sure everything is especially well secured in your trailer. undefined 1483327802We stayed there several years ago, but from reading the reviews, not much has changed.  
The lady that owns the place is very unpleasant, but you can overlook that due to age.  
However, the man that works there, (I think he is her son), is spooky.  
Their website list their nature trails, and there are lovely trails through the woods.  
He followed my husband and I on a walk one day and told us it was private property and to get off.  
There were no signs, nothing that distinguished this trail from any other on the property.  
My kids were afraid of him,  and he did seem to be always watching wherever you went or whatever you were doing.  
The place itself is quite run down, and honestly,  kind of scary.  
The laundry is only open during weird hours during the day so if you are there working you will not be able to wash your clothes.  
Oh, and when you drive in their long rough driveway there are signs warning you to say on the road as they have put nails in the grass!!  
Our stay was several years ago and we still talk about this place as easily the worst campground ever. kenneth bunton ii 1475787541This is a great place to stay.  
Disregard the other negative reviews.   
The host here is wonderful and sweet.   
For example... my awning was torn in a storm and she replaced it.   
This was after her insurance told her that she was not responsible.   
She still felt like she should help out. 
That type of generosity isn't seen much these days.   
I can't wait to stay there again!   
Cheers!  
Dave DeRosia 1505243183They only allow dogs up to 15 lbs. 
Yes 15! 
cmilton111 1469085766I enjoyed my time in this small RV Campground. 
Nice Trails through green forest around the lake (water is overly green or I would give higher rating). 
Love the geese, sunrises and sunsets in this quite park. 
Poppa Don and the crew at Enchanted Shores make you feel like family & special guest all at the same time!  
Whether you're entertained by an outdoor movie/football game or riding in the barrel train it's a great atmosphere to kick back and relax.Manager can't admit when he makes a mistake and will argue with you! 
They advertise wifi, showers, laundry and bathrooms. 
They have NONE of it!!! 
But they still charge the same as when they did. 
They say they're repairing things but it's been this way for almost going on 3 years according to the campground staff. 
The playground is unsafe for children also. 
It is however good location for I-57, not too close but not too far. 
Enchanted Shores Campground has no shores to speak of.  
What they do have, is plenty of noise from the traffic that runs along both streets bordering the corner campground.  
There was no picnic table, the fire ring was in the neighbor's lot, there were very few trees for shade, and the noise from the traffic went on all night.  
I would never recommend staying there.Stopped by today to see what was there and if I wanted to bring my camper there. 
I didn't stop at the office because the sign said it was closed. 
I thought maybe there was some sort of lake or pond there because of the name enchanted shores, but that was false. 
There's nothing there but a run down trailer park. 
Then I was run down my the manager( I guess), who was all upset that I didn't stop at the closed office. 
Very rude and unfriendly. 
I'll never go back again. 
The place is a dump anyway.The park itself was alright. 
The management I found rude. 
I was stopped in my car, a man yelled at me to stop. 
When the man approached my window he didn't announce who he was not even a simple hello. 
He just says can I help you. 
When I told him no and that I'm staying here he proceeded to ask me when I arrived, who I was, and where I was staying in the park in a rude tone. 
Mind you he still hasn't told me who he is so of course I'm giving vague answers to a man that just randomly stopped me in my vehicle.He made me feel unsafe and uneasy. 
He finally did reveal he was one of the managers of the park  he didn't tell me his name or anything. 
Just that he is a manager and said he didn't recognize me and than just left no bye no nothing. 
I found it extremely rude to stop someone in their vehicle and not even announce who you are and than some.The price was reasonable and the bed was comfy enough. 
There were no ice cube trays in our freezer and they don't have an ice machine, so getting in late didn't allow us time to get trays and fill them and wait for ice to form before having a drink at bed time. 
The microwave had not been cleaned and had mold growing on it. 
There was also a centipede in our room. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful and everything else was clean. 
More could be done to easily improve the quality of this hotel.I second guess the cleanliness of the hotel. 
We stayed here one night for a wedding. 
There was scuz on the walls in the bathroom, our microwave was filthy and had a huge hunk of moldy food stuck to the rotating plate. 
Fridge had food boogers in it too. 
We didn't use it so it wasn't that big of a deal but still pretty gross. 
No convenience of ice machine, plates, sliver wear, pots or pans. 
They had one staff member running the front desk so they couldn't deliver anything to our door so, we had to run down to get anything we needed. 
When we booked the hotel it said Continental breakfast but it was only coffee and muffins. 
The staff was friendly. 
The air conditioner worked. 
The bed was comfy. 
Those the only good things i can say. 
I was very disappointed and don't think I'll be back.Management and staff was very friendly and accommodating. 
Room was clean, bed comfortable, amenities provided, free WiFi, nice channel selection and location perfect. 
Kudos for the quietness even though they allow pets. 
Fresh smell throughout hotel!!!
The room was awesome, good size room with microwave, fridge, stove top and even silverware which was unexpected. 
We did however have to wait about 15-20 mins for someone to show up at the desk. 
Not awesome after a 10 hour drive.This hotel is located as such that it is not easily spotted from the highway. 
The staff is friendly, but the service wasn't very impressive. 
We had a room on the second floor that had a kitchenette which was OK but there wasn't anything in the room for cooking, eating and drinking. 
You have to ask at the desk. 
They don't offer amenities so be sure bring your own! 
They might have a small bottle of shampoo and bar soap (which smelled horrible). 
Overall, I was not impressed.This is a very nice hotel for an overnight stay. 
The rooms are clean and what you would expect from a Marriott. 
The staff was very helpful and friendly. 
The breakfast area was large and there was a good variety of items. 
Would definitely return.Room was clean and tidy. 
Bed was comfy and the shower better than expected. 
Staff were all friendly and courteous. 
Even with brewing convention attendees staying in the hotel, it being by a highway and railway line it was quiet and peaceful. 
Would happily stay again if in the area.Clean rooms. 
Friendly staff. 
Convenience of being right off the interstate however be aware that you can somewhat hear the interstate traffic. 
But not really much the hotel can do about that, to be fair. 
I would recommend this hotel. 
Close to the casinos and they have a shuttle.Bed was comfortable but the room had an unusual smell to it. 
Wasn't overpowering but noticeable. 
Staff was friendly and pricing was reasonable.My room was not initially provided with a spare sheet and blanket for the futon, but the staff quickly provided me with the items when asked. 
The blanket did have a hair on it that did not resemble mine. 
The room and complimentary breakfast were both very nice.I took  about 10 black girls (my daughter and her friends) to the Fairfield Inn Tinley Park, IL Marriott Hotels.... 
We were there for about ten minutes when management came to the room. 
They asked us at what time did we plan on not making any noise.  
I was a little confused.. because the girls were not making any noise.  
I asked management did they ask everybody who came in that question or if it was just us.  
Mind you I had 3 rooms more that enough to accommodate us.  
Needless to say I left the hotel to take the kids to the mall only to receive a call that I had to checked out and come get my stuff and that police had been called.  
They also informed me that I would still be charged for the rooms in which I had only checked in and been put out.  
It was discrimination at its finest....Loved the rooms and loved the breakfast and also loved the staff. 
My only complaint is one that I know doesn't effect a lot of people but I really wish there was a better fitness center. 
I understand this isn't a popular topic but for someone like me this is a big deal. 
There were two treadmills that didn't incline, an old elliptical, and a few dumbbells. 
Would have five starred if there was even two more pieces of equipment.Very clean and nice hotel. 
Staff was very polite and the area around the hotel was nice with lots of food choices around. 
I'd definitely stay here with my family.Nice basic hotel, clean, updated, Paul Mitchell tolitries, comfortable beds. employees are helpful and friendly.  
Room was nice size with large couch, that pulled out to bed, large desk, 2 TVs, small microwave & fridge.  
Easy to get to/from Hollywood Casino Ampetheater.  
Several restaurants within a couple blocks, easy walk.Great quality rooms...always clean. 
The setting is very quiet so you won't be disturbed. 
Free breakfast! 
Free WiFi (though it is quite slow)I spent 5 days here and I enjoyed myself. 
All the staff were wonderful but for me Jerome at the front desk was the best! 
He helped me so much! 
He went above and beyond and out of his way to accommodate me and feel welcome. 
He is awesome! 
Jerome gets an Atttttt in customer service.Where do I begin with this place! 
They are amazing from the front desk to every staff member in the place. 
I teach Knock your socks off customer training classes and I would think they had my class lol. 
Anyway this is the best place to stay in Merrillville, IN. 
They made my trip so much more enjoyable. 
Clean, Caring, the warm cookies, good breakfast, and they have fresh water for you all night with lime. 
If you stay here you will not be disappointed. 
Oh don't let me forget the heated pool! 
Thanks again Fairfield Team!
Fairfield Inn was easily located right off the highway in an area with a lot of restaurants, gas stations, shopping, and other big city feels in a small town environment. 
We were traveling as a family for a professional event in the area. 
We felt it was safe and family friendly. 
The service was quick and friendly. 
The room was newly renovated and comfortable. 
Our room had two full size beds which are smaller than what we are used to (we have usually seen queens). 
For our little family it worked fine. 
The breakfast was nice and included hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, fruit, cereal, waffles, yogurt, assorted drinks, and a coffee bar. 
There is an outside pool, however it wasn't open yet, but we stayed the first weekend in June and the weather hadn't been warm enough. 
Nice, clean place. 
Would stay again if in the area.I rented a suite my 3 sisters, mother & myself enjoyed our stay very much! 
The staff is awesome they were very accommodating and helpful. 
The rooms we very clean.... 
I will definitely staying there again! 
Nice clean and friendly staff has a washer and dryer continental breakfast was goodTop top top notch staff.But terrible room conditions.  
Room reeked of smoke and the bed was way too soft for my taste on the first try.  
Asked for another room and they accommodated (although had to go from King to dual queen) and the room was better but one could still tell it was old.Due to the building's condition alone, I'd urge long stay travelers to avoid.  
However if you're judging solely on staff, I'd give it 5 stars.Traveling with senior citizens on this trip. 
Check in was quick and easy. 
Drop off and entry to hotel easy. 
Rooms were spacious enough and clean. 
Breakfast was adequate. 
This was a travel business stop. 
Certainly acceptable, very clean, but an older worn out Fairfield.  
Hospitality was nice, but not overly friendly.  
A place where you had to ask, not going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.Great customer service nice clean rooms beautiful pool area to relaxing with jacuzzi would recommend it and go back againGreat service, great breakfast, great quality room. 
Felt like home. 
There was a lot of stores around it to stay busy.I have been staying at this hotel for a while as a business guest. 
The recent remodel has freshend up the look and feel. 
While not a 5 star hotel, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and always make you feel welcome. 
I always stay at this hotel when in Kankakee.Nice hotel. 
Check-in was very nice and rooms clean. 
Breakfast was better than average and the entire package at a reasonable price.Location isn't the prettiest town, but inside the hotel is amazing. 
Room looks great and they are currently doing renovations to make the hotel even better. 
Hot tub was not working so that was a disappointment, but the pool is still up and running. 
Overall great place.Great location and clean rooms. 
Friendly staff and comp breakfast.Nice for the area. 
But it's a very monotone theme.Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. 
I would definitely recommend paying the extra $ to get access to the breakfast and snacks in the gold club during your stay. 
We got our money's worth of snacks, that's for sure. 
The breakfast was killer. 
I had bagels with lox every morning of our stay and it was heavenly.  
The hotel is centrally located in downtown and within walking distance of the train to get to the airport. 
I would highly recommend this hotel!
Bed was a bit hard for my taste, and the pillows are those old-school feather pillows, which provide no support whatsoever. 
Abroad, most hotels offer internet for free. 
People who come to the Fairmont will be surprised on how much they have to pay. 
Place is a bit secluded from major streets. 
Not really sure what is driving the high premium. $655 for two nights? 
Good luck, mate.The hotel is in a tremendous location. 
It has great views of the city and is extremely well-kept. 
My experience here was to visit a conference and attend some meetings and a suite that was reserved for us and it was really nicely located and done.We are big fans of the Fairmont Seattle, and this was our first introduction to the Fairmont Chicago. 
We had a great view room overlooking the park. 
Service was fantastic, as always. 
This is a great location: just a block to the waterfront parks. 
Our three year old enjoyed both the hotel and nearby playgrounds. 
Recommended!
My lady friend and I spent six nights at this excellent hotel and enjoyed it tremendously. 
Although the hotel could use some updating, our suite was  clean and lovely, with wonderful views of Lake Michigan and the park, and the hotel's location is outstanding. 
In particular, the Concierge staff was fabulous, tending to our requests with enthusiastic response. 
This was my first return to my native city in 30 years, and the Fairmont Chicago made it extremely enjoyable. 
Thanks!
Great hospitality! 
Which is hard to find these days. 
We stayed at Super 8 the night prior and paid what we had paid for two nights there very affordable. 
And after staying at Super 8 we were worried about the environment from our experience at Super 8 but it was terrific nice quiet no complaints we actually felt safer there than we did at Super 8 thank you for the terrific stayVery good customer service. 
They are constantly renovating. 
Some rooms are brand new. 
Very friendly people and quite place to stay.If you come to the Family Inn expecting the stereotypical hotel feel of today's society this is not the place for you. 
But if you want a vintage experience that takes you back to the family road trip vacations of the past then you are in luck with this place. 
The owners are a wonderful couple that accommodated us when we had to come to the tiny town of Watseka unexpectedly for a family funeral with a tight budget. 
They even called the morning after our first night to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed. 
While the rest of my family set up at the run of the mill Super 8 just down the street for $80 a night,  my kids and I got to experience the historical, old time feel of real hospitality at the bargain price of a two night stay for $100. 
I have a lot of family in this area and this will be our home away from home every time we have to come into town. 
The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I don't want to give people unrealistic expectations because of some of the conditions of this historical building, but we were comfortable and felt very safe here.If you are looking for old time courtesy and customer service then FAMILY INN, Watseka must be the choice. 
The property is old no doubt but the manager couple surpassed our expectation of good service with flying colors.Our room was basic but very clean with nice soft linens. 
Bed was firm and comfortable.With room rates so low - 70is and 80is era! 
- there is nothing to write bad about our experience. 
Will recommend them in a heart beat!
Room was ok bed was very clean shower only got warm not hot but not a bad place for 45 bucks Stellar. 
Beautiful corner room with awesome view. 
Treated my kids like royalty. 
Staff was superb. 
Perfect location...steps from Michigan Ave. 
Treat yourself!!!
It was a wonderful stay as always.  
Staff and service was great..Food was high quality and presented so nicely from room service.  
I always stay at this hotel for all these rreasons!!
If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.  
com Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...Nice hotel in the middle of magnificent mile. 
The hotel itself is a bit dated compared to some of the other five star hotels in Chicago, but you won't be able to tell the difference. 
The views are spectacular, make sure you get a room facing the lake!
$7.00 for a glass of milk, because my wife felt ill and needed to take a pill. 
Took the nearly full glass of milk back to the bar, and the bartender told me he couldn't change the prices. 
A nice guy would have just given me a glass of milk. 
There's such a thing called manners and friendliness. 
You have none....Expensive but amazing. 
Room service is phenominal. 
Pool is great but smaller than the picturea make it seem. 
Friendly staff and good food Linda Delia 1506469310The rent keeps going up,and up.They do nothing for you. 
You take care of your lawn. 
They DON'T shovel snow, or put salt down. 
Many empty lots. 
They brag about activities but that is not done by them. 
It is provided by the great people who live here. 
If you want to use the clubhouse. 
You have to provide your own insurance. 
What a joke. 
The golf carts stop on the course. 
The battery's are ancient. 
Think twice about golf vista Denise Harvey 1495210339Very quiet community,  nice place to live but owners don't put much effort into keeping it nice and highest lot rent in the area Ashley Terrell 1504195347Pam is a great person to talk to and very helpful.  
john dunne 1475514607Well worth a visit, absolutely great for a beginner. 
Interestingly it is just right for beneficial exercise you can walk it or rent a cart. 
It is a very attractive course and has some nice little challenges but with the right attitude you will enjoy it , Give it a fair try and you will have fun Sheryll Colbert 1485700952I live here and I have met an wonderful staff and my neighbor have made me feel so welcome and it is right off from a goft course. 
This Hampton Inn was in a great location! 
There were many food and shopping options in the area. 
The staff was very friendly and was able to accommodate us quickly. 
Our room was spacious and very clean, and the free WiFi was great. 
My daughter loves swimming in the indoor pool, I just wish it would have been heated as well as being indoor. 
The continental breakfast had many optuons: cereal, pastries, eggs, sausage, waffles, just to name a few. 
If I'm ever in Matteson, IL again, I would definitely consider staying there again.The hotel hadr been recently renovated and looks very nice and clean. 
The free breakfast is a pretty good quality - normal stuff you'd expect eggs/omelets, pastries, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, sausage/bacon, etc. 
My room was fairly decent, I'm not a bit fan of the A/C units, but it work well so I can't complain. 
The bathroom and shower are nice. 
My biggest issue is that there was no closet in the room, only a chest of drawers, so there was nowhere to hang my nice clothes.My husband and I enjoyed our stay here very much! 
The room was spacious and comfortable, the bed was great, and the whole hotel was clean! 
The service was great as well!
Beautiful, clean, modern hotel. 
Friendly staff, Jennifer was very nice. 
Nice hot breakfast,  great location amongst other restaurants.Stay here twice a year. 
He employees are wonderful and rooms decent and clean. 
I'm happy to stay here.Great location. 
There are so many things to do right outside the hotel. 
The staff was great with no issues with the room. 
The room itself didn't have a fridge and the water pressure was kinda light. 
Other than that is a good room.Nice, comfy and clean. 
Guest services was professional and polite. 
Good spread for comp breakfast. 
Easy access to shopping, dining, etc. 
Just bring your earplugs if you're not used to sleeping in the city- some nights can be a little loud outside!
We traveled to Chicago for a mini getaway from 8/09/17 - 8/11/17.  
Although we've stayed in many luxurious 5 star hotels, Hampton Inn never disappoints and Chicago-Downtown was no exception. 
The front desk and housekeeping staff were amazing and our king suite was lovely.  
If you're willing to sacrifice a skyline or water view, then I highly recommend this hotel. 
The amenities and comfort make up for the view.Location was right around everything. 
Uber in and out or walked with my kids. 
Service was friendly and the breakfast was good. 
They have a decent workout room and a nice pool with sauna. 
We would stay again.My husband and myself have been at this hotel for a month. 
Great location, great restaurants, movie theater, Starbucks and close to Woodfield mall. 
Everyone at the hotel is great, front desk, kitchen and maid service . 
They're Very friendly and professional. 
Couldn't be happier!
Home away from home. 
When I return this will be my home.Very nice place.  
Was clean and comfortable.  
Service was very good.  
However breakfast was well fast and free.The rooms and location is amazing. 
Only about 20 to 30 minutes to Chicago and there are plenty of other great locations near that. 
The rooms were always kept clean.I really enjoyed my stay there. 
This is our second stay and it was just as good both times. 
They have a good selection for the continental breakfast. 
We were able to pretty much have the pool to ourselves. 
They are friendly and helpful.Great hotel. 
Good amenities, clean, and well laid out. 
Nice complimentary breakfast with waffle machines. 
The suite was really well laid out. 
Parking was easy.The lady at the front desk was extremely polite and explained everything clearly. 
Room was clean and everything was where it should be. 
Not a single complaint at allDecent place and clean rooms. 
Friendly staff with pool and hot tub. 
Been here several times with no problems except my first visit. 
The toilet didn't flush properly...so annoying. 
Front desk offered to switch rooms but I declined because it was late night, exhausted and there was a hallway bathroom conveniently outside our door. 
It was just a quick overnight stay. 
Hollywood Casino Amphitheater is very close by along with gas stations and fast food restaurants. 
Older hotel but upgrades have been made. 
Price was super right for the area. 
WiFi was great which is a big deal. 
Staff was amazing. 
Room was smaller ten I'm used too but TV was huge. 
They have upgraded that. 
Only knock is no TV channel guide. 
Seems small but I travel a lotChecked in on Friday night and there was a slight change of plans w our room due to a wedding  booking that was cancelled and then immediately remade. 
Our reservation was made in that small window so we were bumped to another floor. 
Not a big deal at all but the two women at the desk we're so sweet, apologetic and over accommodating that I'm positive if any real issue arose it would have been resolved quickly and efficiently. 
Very clean room and warm, friendly atmosphere.The hotel was beautiful, very modern and comfy. 
The room itself was clean and the bed was wonderful. 
I'd stay here again.Nice room, the pullout couch bed had some popcorn in it, so I'm not sure how clean it was. 
No complaints. 
Breakfast was good.Great place. 
Very friendly and helpful people. 
Breakfast was great and everything hot. 
Great choice if you are heading east and don't want to stay in Chicago.Definitely an older hampton.. 
Still much much better than most hotels in that area. 
Staff was nice and friendly. 
Breakfast was averageI recently stayed at the hotel for about a month; the staff was extremely accommodating in making the stay feel like home.  
One staffer lent (without hesitation) his personal phone charger cord to me when mine stopped working.  
I forgot a hat at the hotel when I left; the staff found the missing article and promptly mailed it back.  
Great customer service!
Nice staff, and the bed was comfortable. 
The air conditioner was very loud, especially when turning on. 
It woke me throughout the night. 
The carpet also felt oddly wet and greasy. 
The location was good for the work I had to do, but I will consider other nearby hotels if I need to be in that area again. 
Great service and the breakfast was fresh. 
I enjoyed my stay here.We got here and the front desk staff was incredibly friendly, allowing us an early check in so that we wouldn't have to carry our luggage around with us while waiting. 
The hotel is very clean, quiet, and the AC works very well at keeping the room incredibly cold. 
My only complaint, and this is really reaching, is that the windows have some sort of old leftover adhesive or maybe dirt stuck to them which clouds the view of outside.I took a trip to Chicago for a few days to take in some sight seeing. 
I have been to Chicago several times and have always stayed in major brand hotels and have never received the treatment that I received at the Hampton Inn Majestic Theater. 
Make sure you are actively looking for this hotel, because it is a small door within a large theater. 
The hotel loby is very inviting and clean. 
The staff is very welcoming and helpful. 
Upon checking in they provided me a water and a list of nearby restaurants that they recommend. 
I went to 4 of those restaurants and all were very good. 
The lobby also offers cookies in the afternoon and they are delicious (butterscotch chocolate chip). 
I was surprised at the quality of these cookies being that they are from a hotel and free. 
I was always able to ask for a bottle of water and they always happily gave me one with a smile. 
I have been to Chicago twice before once at a similar branded hotel and another at a higher class hotel and both rooms were the size of a closet. 
This hotel room was very large and very spacious. 
Which is nice, it was like staying in an airport hotel, but in the heart of the city. 
The hotel has good access to State Street, so if you need quick shopping it is within minutes, red and blue lines are within a block and most major Chicago attractions are within 5-15 minutes walking (Any sporting event you need to take the subway or cab/Lyft). 
Where they knock it out of the park is with their maid service, I never saw the maid, but my room was never cleaner and had more attention at any hotel. 
There was nothing dirty, sheets were in good shape, and the maid always left a note wishing us a nice day. 
The maid also always made figurines with the towels so we had a place for our toiletries. 
There were a lot of small touches this hotel had  that made me feel special as a customer. 
The downfalls are minimal, the continental breakfast is like all of them, stick to the cereal, yogurt, and fruit and also this hotel is in the middle of the Chicago, there is no parking lot, if you rent a car be prepared to pay big bucks to have it parked. 
All in all I would recommend this hotel, especially at this price point. 
You could spend a lot more and have a smaller room and not have good cookies.We stayed here because we were going to Hamilton at the Private Bank Theater and the hotel is right upstairs. 
Great hotel, clean rooms, nice breakfast buffet. 
It wouldn't have killed them to have a few more pillows that actually had some substance to them, but I can deal.Great location except kind of hard to get parked without getting hit or clipped on the street. 
Tons of place to eat/see within walking distance. 
Rooms were great and there was plenty of food at breakfast.Nice rooms, excellent location, just loved it... 
The only thing, our room smelled a little of cigarettes... 
But staff were super friendly and helpful in every possible way.. would totally come back..Could not be more happy with this place. 
It's clean and neat. 
They handed me a free newspaper,hot coffee, fruits,waffles and bottled water. 
They gave me an extra oversized towel and free snacks. 
They gave me a great deal. 
I felt safe and comfortable. 
All the help were so polite and sweet. 
I would live here if they let me.  
Out right perfect stay and I have stayed at many different places and these guys understand hospitalityThe reason why I gave it a 2/5 is because, all of the hotel doors would not shut, we had to pull the door as hard as we could to shut it. #2 is, we had to get a new key every day, and on one of our last days we got locked out of our room and the whole 3rd floor was friends of ours and they were locked out as well. 
We got front desk and they had to get a wire to open the door from the inside. 
Another thing is that the pool and workout room is tiny. 
One of the many other things is that the room is tiny and I have a family of 4 and we could just barely fit. 
Breakfast was delicious though! 
The staff members were nice ?!
Regular Hampton, but the service was amazing. 
We were in town for a funeral. 
My mom tried booking online but there pricing kept jumping around. 
She called and the staff was so helpful, got our rooms booked and greeted is when we got here.First stay here. 
Good location  for our trip. 
Friendly and helpful service!
Very clean despite construction going on. 
Good breakfast and a sweet pool area that we all enjoyed. 
Comfy beds and super close to everything.I  was traveling to Chicago on a budget and stayed at this AWESOME Hostel for 4 nights and a day in late July. 
I had a wonderful time during my stay. 
With it located on Congress downtown I was able to safely walk or take the Chicago public transportation system to all of my daily excursions. 
The rooms are very nice and clean that connect with a kitchen and bathroom/shower. 
The rec area (pool tables and lounge) was great to sit down in after a long day and relax. 
The breakfast was good although not more than a few small pastries, cereal, fruit, bagels and toast. 
Check in front desk and employees were very helpful with questions and needs. 
Overall a very nice and enjoyable experience at the Hi Chicago Hostel. 
When I can get back to Chicago this will be my first place to make a reservation. 
JayIf you're looking for a nice quaint little hotel, this is not the place. 
It's probably more comparable to a dorm mixed with a camp. 
But if you're traveling in a large enough group that you can put 8 people of the same gender into a room, it's pretty nice. 
For the price, it's a great place. 
Pretty clean, conveniently located, complimentary breakfast, etc.Very affordable, clean rooms and bathrooms, friendly and helpful staff, and the location is perfect. 
It's next to shopping and theatres  on State Street, several different train stations and a couple blocks from Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain. 
The Greyhound bus Station is only about 7-8 blocks away or $7 cab ride. 
Union Station is also close by, within walking distance. 
Blues legend Buddy Guy's cafe/blues club is only a couple blocks away. 
I will definitely be coming back!
Near to everything, 2 blocks from millennium park, with a lot of free activities (jazz night, walking tours). 
Only two blocks from the airport metro line. 
Bathroom is inside of the bedroom with a separate shower that made it very confortable and private. 
There is a laundry with coins. 
Breakfast is all days the same and it could be improved. 
People in the front desk is very helpfulHI Chicago was an amazing hostel to stay at. 
It was right down the block from the beautiful Melenium Park. 
I was with a group of 14 and all of us could comfortably stay in 1 room and the service was really nice as well. 
On the second floor for occupants was a lounge area with pool tables, a ping pong table and couches and chairs if you just want to relax with a T.V. in the backEverything about my stay was wonderful. 
From the excellent customer service, to the beautiful room, was amazing. 
The bed was just the best! 
I slept the best that I've slept in a long time. 
The room was clean and beautifully decorated and comfortable. 
The views were amazing. 
And the staff was great.As always Hilton's in big cities are always  a hit! 
It can never be a bad choice at Hilton. 
Great location in downtown Chicago. 
The service here was higher than expected. 
Maybe because I'm from LA, and service in LA usually is not top notch. 
Would highly recommend this hotel especially if you're a Hilton honors member.Location is perfect for walking to Navy Pier and other sites. 
Close to some great restaurants. 
Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. 
Only quibbles are no bathtub and the pool has no hot tub (but has a gorgeous view of the lake, and it's clean!) 
Service so far has been good. 
Our only interaction has been with the doormen/valet, all of whom greet us warmly.Excellent rooms. 
Clean. 
Some of it is still a little dated but overall very nice. 
The people were helpful and friendly. 
It was easy to get to and in a great location to get around to a lot of different things in Chicago. 
Many in walking distance. 
There is self park right down the street and valet parking also. 
It's not over the top and there aren't a ton of frills but it's really got everything you could need and the prices are very good too.Rooms are nice, renovated and very spacious. 
The lobby and elevators are old, but don�t let that scare you when you walk in. 
Also, you may want to bring your own blow dryer. 
The in room has one speed and will take quite a bit to blow dry your hair!
In Chicago for a birthday party, the catering staff was wonderful, and the restaurant staff was great also, especially Barb our waitress at breakfast and Sunday brunch. 
Rooms were clean, so no complaints. 
I have been to many affairs at the hotel, but it was the first time staying in a room. 
I plan to come back!
Got to hotel after check in time and room wasn't ready.... they asked us to choose one that was and I didn't like it at all....  
there were huge red and black stains all over the carpet ...15 minutes later I was able to get room I requested.  
No fridge in room or microwave so pizza leftovers were wasted. 
For $200 complimentary soft drinks  and appetizers and breakfast buffet softened the blow some what.  
Staff is friendly and hotel is convenient to several attractions. 
Total time spent in room was less than 9 hours .  
I would give it 2.75 stars.We had a great stay at your hotel. 
The staff was extremely helpful, going above and beyond what we expected! 
Housekeeping was absolutely amazing with keeping privacy an importance to us, they simply put a note under the door asking if we wanted service as it had been a few days since we checked in and the DND sign was up. 
The front desk staff even put our pizza's in a freezer overnight for us. 
The shuttle driver gave us some great info to help navigate the city. 
All of you made this vacation with my daughter very enjoyable, thank you! 
We will stay again when we come back!
Me and my wife's first time experience at the Hilton hotel was professional warm and welcoming. 
They provided us with what we needed. 
The rooms were great and the bar was magnificent. 
I will recommend the Hilton hotel to my friends and family!!!
Pretty good. 
Rooms are clean and comfortable, the bar and restaurant are ok. 
Good beer selection. 
Staff are all friendly and helpful. 
Be sure to ask for a quiet room, there is a railway line right alongside.The hotel is located very centrally, right on Michigan Ave. 
It was. 
Wry close to walk to talk the L to many Chicago attractions and landmarks like Wrigley field, Willis tower, the bean, the pier, the planetarium and more. 
The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. 
The hotel is gorgeous with elaborate designs and features like their grand stair cases, chandeliers in the ballroom, and fountains. 
The rooms were spacious and clean with great views of the city. 
I would definitely stay here or attend events here in the future.We had a block of three rooms. 
They couldn't put us anywhere near each other. 
My in-laws rooms had ants, like a lot of ants. 
Our room was fine. 
But I checked my statement for my credit card last week and found that someone else had charged almost $80 to my room. 
How is this possible?!? 
They told me they would look up the receipts and sort it out and get back to me in 2-3 days. 
It's been a week and no contact. 
I'm likely going to have to dispute the charges and figure out it another way. 
The location is nice and the hotel has historic beauty,  but it's just not worth all of this hassle.I worked a private event at the hotel that covered multiple floors and can say that the Hilton is gorgeous. 
I live in the South Loop and have walked by the hotel multiple times but had never been inside- it gorgeous to say the least. 
The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly to myself and team members. 
All of the rooms we used were clean and fully stocked at all times with anything we asked for. 
I would absolutely come back as a guest and will be referring family and friends to stay here during their next trip to Chicago.Maintenance items to address: I�m a Hilton Diamond member. 
As a person who travels as part of job, I�m leaving this review as balanced and unbiased.I have stayed at this hotel many, many times. 
All of my stays are for a minimum of 10-12 days. 
These stays are always part of a business trip and with a group. 
Parking is pricey. $75 per day - valet. 
The service, attentiveness, and attitude of the staff is always spot on.  
No complaints with the staff. 
The hotel itself is getting a bit tired. 
It definitely needs freshened up.The biggest complaint I have is losing the executive lounge. 
Why take the lounge out?
It�s a grand hotel and has always held a special place in my heart but she needs some attention.The hotel is easy to access from main street. 
Interior is clean and welcoming lobby. 
Very open space, surprisingly they have an entire hair salon downstairs! 
Along with some cool anaxj shops and 2 gift shops. 
The pool is clean and gives you a great overlooking out to the park and lake. 
Room was comfortable and secure.The hotel is updated and clean. 
Our room was a suite and it was very spacious and had a mini fridge (no freezer), coffee maker, and plenty of counter space. 
The living area was very nice, too, with a couch and chair and a couple of benches. 
We had a great experience except for the fact that, despite us making a conscious effort to keep it down during later hours, we got several noise complaints, including one while we we're sleeping at 6am!!?! 
I felt as if we were targeted because they knew we were with a group. 
One time they threatened us with a $2000 fine, which I felt was unprofessional especially since several of the noise complaints may have actually been caused by another room but blamed on us. 
I'm guessing the walls here are just paper thin. 
Despite these complaints we liked the hotel based on the room itself and its proximity to downtown locations.Prime location in the middle of downtown Chicago: a 5 minute walk to the Magnificent Mile, 20 minute walk to the Bean, and there's an L station right down the block. 
Room was clean, and had good amenities (mini-fridge, microwave, safe, USB charging ports on the lamp, in-room wifi). 
The shower heated up quickly, which helped to thaw my frozen toes after doing all kinds of touristy things in November in Chicago. 
The wall unit heater worked quite well, heating up the room quickly. 
Front desk staff was super helpful with food recommendations and directions, and responded quickly when I needed extra blankets in the room (I wasn't quite prepared for the Chicago cold!). 
Overall, I'd happily stay here again if I'm ever back in the Chicago area.Nice room, clean and quiet. 
We had issue with our heater which was quickly fixed-staff was very helpful and apologetic. 
Very convenient to Subway. 
Would stay here again.Overall, we had a pleasant and comfortable stay at this hotel. 
The location is good, downtown, just a street off the Magnificent Mile. 
The room was clean and with a modern decor. 
The kids enjoyed the pool. 
I knocked off and star for the staff at the reception when we arrived; very rude and not welcoming. 
Oh, our room was equipped with a fridge and microwave, which was convenient for keeping a few snacks.Stay was pretty great overall. 
Staff was very friendly and accommodating, but I had a few problems. 
The beds were hard and the pillows disappeared when you laid your head down. 
The hot tub was also cold for one of the nights I was there.Overall, nice place. 
Solid facilities. 
I wish the pool and gym were bigger but they are serviceable. 
Clean, quiet, and hospitable. 
Plus, breakfast is great.Got a great price from Expedia. 
Clean, public parking right next door, can leave and come back for same daily charge. 
Nice large rooms. 
Good service, very quiet, blackout curtains, breakfast buffet for a charge. 
Nice location between business and residential.Nice clean hotel. 
Very helpful and friendly front desk and dining room staff. 
Was very disappointed that cleaning staff completely ignore do not disturb signs and barged into room.Stay here often for work. 
Nestled in the nice town of Evanston near Northwestern University. 
Great restaurants and Cafe's in the area. 
Friendly staff, decent rooms, decent restaurant, bar and amenities within the hotel. 
Haven't had any bad experiences yet.Room was clean, service was friendly, and neighborhood was quaint.  
Pool was small, as was the exercise facilities.  
Continental breakfast cost $9, and the extended buffet was $13 food was alright, but I wouldn't recommend it for the cost.  
Good stay of your looking for something right outside Chicago.Bad bed. 
Cannot believe what lousy mattresses this hotel has. 
Very disappointed.  
Also a great deal of noise and commotion from other rooms during the night. 
Cancelled rest of our reservation.When we first checked in with the wedding party the hotel stated they had a zero noise policy. 
At first I laughed and thought we will see about that. 
They explained that the lobby and courtyard can be used and that noise was acceptable in these areas. 
This policy actually made the time spent there more enjoyable for everyone who went.The breakfast was amazing!!
There was a guest in our party that checked into the room for 2 nights but ended up leaving 2 hours after check-in because she was going into labor. 
The hotel allowed the guest to checkout and comped the entire cost of the room with no hassle. 
Great customer service.This hotel is great. 
Location is very convenient with plenty of places to eat around. 
The service was great,  rooms are modern and clean.Clean and quiet room. 
Enjoyed my stay. 
I stay here every time I come to Chicago!
Five minutes from Metra Mokena/Hickory Creek station. 
Excellent staff. 
Yummy breakfast. 
A little dated but plans are in the works for upgrades soon. ????
The hotel is alright but I'm not happy with the cleaning. 
The room I was originally assigned to had a dirty tub. 
It looked like dirty water had sat and dried in the tub. 
Front desk was very friendly and moved me to another room. 
This room seemed to have a cleaner bathroom. 
However this one now had a dirty pillow case. 
I understand makeup can stain (and I really hope it was a stain and not that they weren't changed) but it was fairly obvious. 
You'd think they wouldn't use it again. 
Restaurant is good. 
Pricey but that's to be expected at most hotels.Excellent customer service. 
My family & I experience a house fire and our insurance company set us up here. 
Everyone on staff has been absolutely wonderful. 
From managers, housekeeping, maintenance and front desk managers. 
EVERYONE has been very nice and accommodating to my family and I. 
Highly recommend for any occasion.Last minute decision to stay here due to traffic jams on I57. 
Got the last room due to same traffic jam.  
Whirlpool tub had a weird shower. 
Otherwise great stay. 
Clean and comfortable. 
Comped breakfast by being a Hilton Honors member. 
Good value.Good service. 
High prices here. 
Breakfast not included. 
Adjustable firmness of bed ?. 
Clean. 
It's a conference center. 
Hot tub, pool, exercise room (we did not try). 
Fridge and microwave.The room was clean. 
The lobby was clean and welcoming. 
There were cookies and water laid out as you entered the lobby. 
The gym is small but adequate. 
The check in process was quite slow but it's understandable as there was an emergency of someone fainting and collapsing somewhere in the hotel. 
Overall it's a clean hotel and I'd stay here again if I need a hotel nearby.Took my family of 5 to stay at the Hilton Garden IN to go to the Deep River Water Park! 
Everyone we came in contact with so polite, friendly, and genuine good people! 
Not only did they make sure our stay was awesome, they went of their way to talk to us and our family. 
The people at reception and the ladies we came in contact with during breakfast were absolutely wonderful! 
Made our experience a great one! 
Will definitely come back!!
Nice, clean hotel. 
Friendly, helpful people at the desk and check in was fast.  
The only knocks is no hot tub & no free breakfast.  
We just looked at the breakfast bar but charging 9.95 for the exact same breakfast that other hotels serve for free is silly.Lacks professionalism in a big way. 
A guy told us he would pay for our rooms. 
The staff seemed upset about it. 
The help walked passed me and said out loud you guys are idiots for believing a complete stranger would cover your rooms. 
We sure made an ass out of her because he paid for all of our rooms in full. 
We were truly blessed by this gentlemen. 
He said he thinks they are giving us such a hard time because we are people of color and he would no longer do business with them. 
He was thinking about doing some sort of campaign with them and said forget about it.Very clean with friendly and helpful staff.  
Was there for a 2 day meeting where the hotel catered the lunches which were very well done with nice presentation.  
Good breakfast and friendly bar.1st room we got had wet carpeting and smelled bad. 
Told clerk and he was very courteous and gave us a 2nd room. 
No wet carpeting but still had bad smell and bathroom mirrors were dirty. 
Pillows were uncomfortable. 
Workers were very courteous though..This is a truly wonderful and civilized hotel with incredibly friendly and understanding staff. 
The facilities are all very well-maintained and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. 
It's located in the heart of downtown Evanston so everything is within walking distance.A shout out to the front desk supervisor, Michael B. 
He's as professional and wonderful as it gets!
This is a nice hotel in a great location, but the room we got was really really small. 
Like, it was comical that they even crammed a king size bed in there. 
I've stayed in tiny hotel rooms in NYC before, but this room was shaped on an angle, making it even tighter and more awkward to move around. 
The room had quality furnishings though and the staff was friendly.Very nice updated hotel. 
Within walking distance of many great restaurants and barsI only visited and not staid here. 
The lobby looks nice, the room I saw seemed small with the tiniest sink I have ever seen in a Hilton.Great experience right from the moment I entered.The staff working here are willing to help with anything you need.The room I slept in was modern and comfortable.What a joke at the bar. 
This guy cares more about his friends then the customers. 
As a regular patron through my company this is a joke. 
Week drinks n no service unless your a personal friend.  
Disappointed is to say the least.. 
Dwayne cares more about personal friends then customers, not like anyone cares. 
What's a joke. 
Bad language n customers are disregarded for friends.  
Never had worse service from this hotel chain  period. 
Makes me rethink my loyalty.Nice stay. 
Very friendly staff. 
Lots of attention paid to small comforts. 
I appreciate a hotel that goes above and beyond with the little toiletries in the bathroom! 
Haha. 
Comfy beds and pillows, nice furniture, bathroom was small but well appointed. 
Great location also.Recently stayed for work. 
Checked in Sunday night departed Thursday morning. 
I noticed a bite on my arm. 
Didn't think much of it in the morning. 
By mid afternoon noticed several more bites. 
Currently have 12-15 bites on my arms, legs, feet and face. 
Anything that wasn't covered by clothing. 
I immediately contacted the hotel to let them know so they could check the room and treat it before any other guests had to deal with this. 
The front desk person was friendly and apologetic. 
I wasn't irrate or rude.  
I was told the manager was unavailable and was in a meeting but would call me back immediately. 
I gave my name and number. 2+ hrs and counting still zero call. 
Bed bugs happen, I know that but I think how a hotel handles bed bugs says a lot about a hotel. 
I will note that the head board on the bed has a gap even though most hotel chains have gone away from this due to the fact it gives bugs a place to hide. 
I informed my managers as this is a hotel we frequently use for employee training classes as well as regular stays.Stay here once a month for work. 
Good location, right by the blue line and two blocks from Union Station. 
Staff are friendly and courteous. 
Mini fridge in most rooms.This is the second time we've stayed at the Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago downtown. 
It's conveniently located near the center of downtown Chicago. 
The hotel is clean, the rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful. 
They have a pool located on the top floor. 
The hotel has all the amenities you'd expect. 
They have a nice restaurant on the floor level that doubles as the room service kitchen. 
Parking is expensive, but there is a city lot next door as an option. 
Package deals for the room with parking included at a discount are available online. 
We had secured one of those packages, but we had to point out the discounted parking to the staff at check-in. 
They were pleasant and accommodating when we pointed that out. 
Over all, we have enjoyed staying here and look forward to returning on future visits.We recently stayed at this hotel for a night with my husband and two kids ages 10 & 16.  
The service was outstanding! 
From the amazing bellman to the friendly front desk staff.Jay was able to make our check in process quick and easy with a bit of humor and a big smiling face.... exactly what we all needed after a long drive into the busy hectic city of Chicago!
The room was clean and comfortable.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay and relax while being close and convenient to shopping & restaurants in the heart of Chicago!!
All staff members we interacted with were friendly, professional, and helpful. 
The hotel itself is in a great location - close to river walkway, restaurants, and House of Blues (reason for overnight stay). 
Room was very clean and bed comfortable. 
Would absolutely recommend this Holiday Inn and consider returning in the future.Great staff. 
Got 19 floor corner suites. 
Beautiful view until the next building grow next to it.currently, can see all view.Great place to stay. 
Close to many restaurants.Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city, surrounded by the Chicago river. 
Always have a rough time finding in with google maps but once we are there we don't take our car out again. 
Only $40 for 24 hour parking. 6 blocks to the train or cabs waiting right the the doorstep. 
Nice bar area & restaurant in the hotel. 
Have not tried the indoor pool but looks great with a dome over the top. 
Rooms are clean and beds are super comfy. 
Cannot beat the views! 
Have stayed here 2x in past month and plan to again in August.We we're at this hotel for a tech conference. 
Though it is a bit odd with the lobby being on the 15th floor, the staff made it easy to understand. 
From the bellmen on the street to the reception staff everyone was kind and helpful. 
The views from my room we're spectacular, and the room itself comfortable. 
Great experienceHoliday Inn Chicago Tinley Park Convention Center was very easy to find from Interstate 80. 
Holiday Inn had attractive comfortable rooms. 
The rooms were a very quick walk to the Convention Center. 
The Convention Center itself was laid out very sensibly and individual rooms were easy to locate. 
Parking was free and convenient. 
I would definitely attend a conference here again.A wonderful time for  sure. 
This particular Holiday Inn is more upscale than what you might be expecting from a Holiday Inn. 
The food for breakfast and in the lounge was fabulous, housekeeping was on point & everyone was very polite. 
It's a very nice place to stay we'll stay every time we're anywhere near.Not bad, staff are friendly and accommodating. 
Your only real option for anything at the convention center. 
Restaurant us unimpressive.The hotel was adequate with a restaurant called Bananas. 
We tried to get a drink at the bar at 11:45 p.m. but was told it was last call so had to drink quickly. 
Bartender told another patron that it was closed and it was only 11:55. 
Close to Hollywood casino amphitheater. 
Did not use their restaurant.Beautiful place to stay with awesome food and breakfast. 
Staff is very attentive to needs and if by chance something is amiss, they go out of their way to compensate. 
Came here to swim with the kids. 
Usually have good luck with holiday inns. 
The pool had mold or some kind of organic material growing in it. 
Very gross.Nice, clean.  
Soft mattresses.  
Polite staff.Blinds/curtains don't close fully - makes it difficult to get a good night's sleepGreat front desk staff. 
Fastest check-in ever! 
Nice clean rooms.Location was great, close to all the food choices and away from the highway. 
Rooms are dated but my king suite was quite spacious. 
Service at check in and check out was great. 
Breakfast was great as always. 
Some usb hubs by the bed would be greatI booked a non smoking room online. 
When we got there the room smelled overwhelmingly of smoke. 
I talked to the lady at the front desk and she claimed to not know anything about it. 
The other rooms that were nonsmoking had a sign on the door. 
Ours did not so i knew it wasnt a nonsmoking room. 
She gave us febreeze. 
She said housekeeping would use a machine to draw out the smoky air. 
It didnt work. 
When we checked out we mentioned it to another staff member. 
He told use the rooms used to be smoking and were recently converted to nonsmoking. 
He even took a little off our bill for the inconvenience. 
But I was disappointed that the first employee basically lied to us and wouldn't admit those were smoking rooms up until recently.Blood, hair and bread crumbs in bed!
First of all, the front desk cheat me that they are booked out so they can't offer me an upgrade at check-in, which they weren't.Then when I got in to the room, I saw 3 hairs in bed. 3! 
I really doubt if they changed the sheets.I went to the front desk and asked for a room change. 
There was no apology, they just gave me the key to another room, which was a suite.When I went to the second room, I found hair on the pillow, blood on the pillow, and bread crumbs in bed! 
Did they really clean the room?
They I got the second room change. 
By this time, I finally heard an apology. 
And I've been switched to another suite. 
It is also ironic that they told me they are booked out at checking-inWhen checking out, they offered me extra 500 points (about $3) as a compensation. 
This makes me feel even worse. 500 POINTS????
Pretty nice updated place. 
Using the app to book this place made it difficult to make any changes to stay. 
This is unfortunate. 
The receptionist forgot to offer water and snack.Terrible service, had to cancel and they would not refund any of my money.  
I had three days prepaid.  
Will never stay at a Holiday Inn Express again and I will advise my friends to do the same.   
I can see charging a crenelation fee but this is pretty much theft.I don't get to stay at hotels much, but the room was excellent. 
Very clean, staff was very nice, free breakfast was delicious, and the wifi was very fast. 
Would definitely recommend.Clean motel for the area and great staffI stay here often and its not a bad hotel.  
The people at the front desk are courteous.  
I do wish they would change the items on the breakfast menu occasionally. 
Often there are long black hairs in the bathroom.  
I guess its from the housekeeping personnel.  
Other than that, decent place to stay.I have stayed here a couple times. 
It can be a bit pricey at times. 
They have a decent breakfast, better than I've had at many other hotels. 
The room is ok in size, did notice some slight wear and tear in the bathroom that was repaired. 
They have a small gym but something is better than nothing, a pool, and business center. 
Overall, my stay wasn't half bad either times I've stayed. 
The staff was friendly when I talked with them.I had the worst experience at this hotel!!!!!! 
I was there for a wedding for my niece and I'm disabled and requested a handicapped room,we checked in which they never told my sister and my niece who booked over at least 20 rooms that we would be charged $25 extra each night for a deposit if we rented a movie, if not when we checked out that money would be added back on your card!?!? 
Then I go into my room and I'm 5ft and the bed was up to the top of my ribs, I had no way of getting up in my bed, I tried and when I did I fell hitting the night stand, the bed from, my oxygen tank, finally meeting my destination "THE GROUND" screaming in pain looking like a star fish on the ground, they showed little to no compassion, everything in that room was lowered for handicapped and wheel chair accessible, accept the bed that night I fell I slept in the chair with an Ottoman, til the next day when maintenance fame in and lowered the bed, so I guess if your handicapped or disabled ask them to lower your bed before you get there.......this happened on September 30th in still healing from that fall??
The rude lady "penny" hung up on me. 
Friday 13th 2017. 
When I did get them on the phone they were rude. 
They implied that they can't help me with out a credit card. 
After I read my information they told me I could cancel until 6pm. 
When my plans changed I called them an hour later to cancel. 
They charged me 160$ for a room I did not stay in. 
I did not check in. 
I cancelled 3 hours before check in. 
They stole 160$ without explaining their exploitation policy at the time of sale. 
These thief's are running there own shady policies against corporate. 
I know they sold that same room.  
They will not make it long enough in this world without learning the very basics in normal phone conversation and honesty. 
I would have paid twice as much if they explained their reservation policies. 
These kind of tricks will not keep this location open long.I really enjoyed this property. 
It wad very clean and the staff was helpful. 
They had the new coffee makers in the rooms free coffee in the lobby.Great room with Queen Bed, Desk, and a view of John Hancock. 
No frills hotel in a prime location. 
Nearest parking for $48/24hrs. 
Recommend higher floor for a view if interested. 
A/C worked very well on hot summer day/nights. 
Fitness room was well equipped. 
Business center available if needed. 
Other guests were able to leave luggage with the hotel on checkout so they could explore the area for more time before their desired departure from the city. 
Would recommend to anyone looking to stay near the Magnificent Mile on a budget.Excellent location and bargain priced compared to the competition.  
Rooms are small but clean and the AC works great.  
Only two small elevators which get backed up so a lower floor room will let you use the stairwell.  
Surprisingly good free breakfast buffet.Loved the customer service, but the hotel, at least my room, needed some work. 
Had to shoulder check the room door to get in. 
The wall around the door was cracked. 
Door handles for the bathroom and the closet were broken. 
There was hardly any space in the bathroom to do anything but turn around. 
Aside from the room, the breakfast was delicious. 
They had yummy cinnamon rolls.The other reviews are correct. 
The rooms are small and it needs a facelift but if all you're looking for is a shower and a bed this is perfect. 
I will also say that one thing I took for granted was lack of a mini fridge.  
That becomes a big deal when you're out at night and you bring back leftovers and then you realize you can't keep them. 
If you're a single guy looking for a place to crash you can't beat the price. 
If you're traveling with some other people that have higher standards you might want to look elsewhere.When we arrived the staff was helpful unloading our bags and getting us checked in and to our room. 
But that's where the good things stop. 
The rooms are itty bitty. 
So small that two people is too many. 
The walls are so thin YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING!!! 
The elevator, the neighbors opening their doors, the neighbors moving a paper cup on their desk. 
It's ridiculous. 
We asked for a different room and apparently you have to do that before 10am!!! 
Ya like I knew I'd be sleeping next to a dang elevator when I checked in at 12. 
Not again.Booked a Jacuzzi suite for sweeties  day got bumped for wedding party then gives a handicap room for compensation.  
not  recommending for return this is appauling/room  wreaked  open season for anyone to walk in don't  bother for breakfastI stayed at Holiday Inn for four nights. 
I had a room with king bed. 
Service is excellent, you get good selection of food for breakfast. 
I would stay here againUpon arrival, this hotel had the normal appearance. 
Front desk staff was nice. 
I arrived late Friday night and previously called ahead to confirm late check-in. 
My room was fine: standard double beds, office area, tv, and a window. 
The tub was slightly discolored. 
What I immediately noticed while trying to sleep was other guest doors slamming and shaking my room. 
A few times I looked to see if someone had broken into my room...That's how loud it was. 
The next evening, there were kids constantly running up and down the halls. 
Once I reported this to the front desk, it was immediately addressed. 
I checked out foreday Sunday morning. 
When I went to check out, there was no one at the front desk. 
After 15 minutes, a couple walked in through the doors to see the "Sold Out" sign on the desk. 
I was concerned that the front desk was unattended and the front entrance was open!!!!!!! 
I even picked up the courtesy phone a couple of times but it only rang the abandoned front desk. 
Then, 2 guys came in stating that the woman at the front desk went to see if their room was available. 
It had been 20 minutes with no one at the front desk. 
Finally, the woman returned and asked whether I wanted to check out. 
She had what appeared to be red syrup or maybe even blood on her forearm. 
Strange! 
I took my receipt and got out of there. 
Did not count the noise from kids against them as things happen. 
But the noisy doors and strange front desk disappearance were what my issues were.Great experience here! 
Accommodations were clean and quiet. 
Would definitely stay again.Standard hotel, nothing special about it and nothing that separates it from another hotel besides price. 
Beds are comfy, though firm, room heat/ac works great (wall/window unit). 
Bathroom was not clean, obvious signs of this. 
Unlike other hotels I've stayed at that I feel are direct competitors, holiday in express lacks enough outlets/USB ports to charge/user devices.Great place. 
They people that work there will go above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable. 
Be good to them.  
They deserve it. 
Especially the manager. 
Great people. 
I've stayed there more times than I can remember and I have never been disappointed.Buyer Beware!!!! 
If you make a reservation with this Hotel and choose to cancel make sure you receive and save your conformation number. 
You will be charged and forced to dispute the charges. 
I am out over eighty dollars for services I never received with absolutely no understanding or compassion.Very easy to get in and out!! 
Very reasonable rates nice and cleanWell worth the money. 
Wasn't fancy but was nice n comfortable!
Clean, easy access, reasonable rates, friendly staff, quiet area of town. 
Close to where I grew up, a good place for me to use when I go back to visit.Let me preface this with I am picky and difficult to please. 
Excellent stay (3rd time for us). 
Customer service friendly and attentive. 
Very accommodating.  
Huge, updated rooms with a full kitchen and fridge/freezer (this nursing/pumping mama was grateful!). 
Great location, walking distance to many wonderful restaurants JOE'S (!) 
And attractions.  
Always a smooth stay when we are there.Room is good for 2 plus a child or two. 
Three adults is a no go. 
That hide-a-bed is insanely uncomfortable. 
Had to put mattress on floor. 
Great location. 
Use a parking app, half price around the corner. 
Provide dinner and breakfast, both were well stocked and better then the average hotel breakfast.The hotel was centrally located and provided easy access to some nice restaurants and good shopping. 
The breakfast buffet was also pretty decent. 
However, we did have some negative issues. 
After being told at check-in that our luggage would be brought right up, we sat in our rooms for about 30 minutes and had to go back down to get our bags ourselves. 
We also had issues getting our room cleaned on the second day. 
We called for service at about 4:30 pm and were told someone would be right up. 
We called again at about 5:40 when no one had shown up yet. 
Finally, after no response by 6:15, I went down in person. 
They finally sent someone up. 
For what we spent on our stay, I would have expected better service. 
I give it 3-stars for the great location, but we will not be staying here again, unfortunately.We had a beautiful modern suit with a small kitchen and living room and a beautiful bedroom and bathroom. 
I loved that the windows open, the view this time was not the greatest. 
The only thing missing from that suit is a large jetted tub and a grand shower, the space is there. 
Overall it was very nice.Great location with everything within a 15 minute walk. 
The rooms are clean and well organized. 
Everything looks brand new and flawless. 
There is complimentary hot breakfast and dinner and an in door pool and gym! 
I was so impressed with the hotel and it has to rank in the top 5 hotels I've ever stayed in.Nice sized room and comfortable bed. 
Would have preferred a king bed, not sure why a hotel would have queen or double beds primarily. 
Bathroom lighting could be better as there is only on pretty dim light. 
Public space is nice, the social hour is a nice touch. 
Breakfast was good, selection covered all bases and was very conveniently laid out. 
Gym was basic but worked for the purpose. 
Overall an nice place to stay, would recommend or stay again.Very nice experience. 
Beautiful friendly hospitality staff. 
The place was very clean and it had a nice breakfast.I'm not used to staying in a suite so I'm not sure what's expected but the room is large, has a work desk, a small dining table in the kitchen, and a couch. 
King-sized beds are apparently very limited. 
There is a full fridge and freezer, microwave, a stovetop, dishwasher and utensils and a few plates and a pot but if u want to actually cook something from scratch you'll at least need your own spices. 
Small indoor pool and workout room. 
Complimentary breakfast (eggs, sausage, fruit etc.) and a happy hour with beer, wine and some grub.The rooms are clean and pretty nice. 
They serve at least breakfast and dinner on weekdays, both of which were not terrible. 
The staff have all been very courteous and helpful in every interaction.Everyone in this hotel  was very friendly.  
Check in was fast and easy. 
The room was very clean and bed very comfortable.Michael at the front desk was great!  
I am an early riser for exercise, and he was quite helpful and I felt quite safe in entering/exiting the hotel.  
Additionally, when I asked in advance to have my vehicle at 6:15 a.m., it was there waiting for me when I checked out.  
The only thing I think I had a little trouble with (and I am quite a clean freak) is that when I went to plug in my laptop and phone to work from the room, the outlets were not real convenient to the work desk and I noticed build-up of dust in those areas where you don't readily see.  
All in all, the cleanliness and location were great!  
There's a great little coffee/sandwich shop on the next block called Hero, and it's convenient to State Street, Michigan Avenue, and the Loop.  
There's also a Gino's East right across the street. 
The weight room is sufficient for a quick workout while traveling and does fine as long as you aren't expecting your franchised big gym.  
Especially if you're traveling for business, this was a great place to stay.Hotel Blake is a Chicago destination smack in the best part of downtown. 
It is classy, upscale, yet personable in the best way possible. 
Come her, stay here, and be sure to ask for "Showtime" at the door for the best advice about directions, restaurants, deals, and transportation. 
The service is fantastic plus toy can reach the best destinations in Chicago on foot or via public transportation. 
Definately come here.Rooms are nice! 
Every staff member we met was so friendly,  especially Showtime!! 
A very sweet man who can tell you where to eat no matter what you want or what you didn't know you wanted! 
Hotel Blake is conveniently located to all the popular tourist attractions . 
Would definitely stay here again!
it honestly was such a great place to stay. a gentlemen greeted me at the door, and was very polite. the rooms had really high ceilings and the view wasn�t all that great, it was a brick wall. but hey, it was still really good. the streets were really loud, but we were on like the 2nd or 3rd floor. i enjoyed my stay.Great location if you want to walk to Grant Park, Buckingham fountain, shops, Garrett's popcorn, theatres,... 
Gino's East South Loop is across the street. 
Staff have been helpful, friendly & professional. 
Rooms are nice; size & views vary. 
Small frig & microwave in rooms.Great stay. 
I requested a fridge kind of last minute, they had it for me. 
The room is very very clean, and I absolutely love the rain shower and the scent of the soap products they provide. 
Friendly concierge. 
Comfy bed. 
Very quiet. 
Room is very small but perfectly fine that way as far as I'm concerned. 
Located close to whole foods, a great little raw vegan restaurant and a liquor store. 
Everything I would need in walking distance and public transportation was incredibly easy and reliable for someone like me who hadn't used it in a large city before. 
All in all, if/when I come back to Chicago I will definitely stay at Hotel Felix again :)Such a cute hotel! 
The location is central and the staff are extremely nice! 
I was running late to check out because I was stuck on the other side of town so I called explaining everything and they completely understood and didn't charge me any extra fees. 
The rooms are modern and cozy. 
Very relaxing place to stay at Chicago!
It's a pretty boutique hotel, I didn't like the hallway had a funny smell but the room was clean, we got early check-in without paying extra charge, free cup of coffee in the morning. 
No problem with noise from other rooms. 
Big TV which is great if you're traveling with a toddler, bed was comfortable and big enough for the three of us (hubby, daughter and me). 
Valet parking was quick and a very reasonable price considering you don't worry about looking for a parking spot in Chicago and you can get in and out as many times as you like. 
Since the hotel is near to a lot of stuff, you only need the car for very specific things.Nice location close to a whole foods. 
That has a parking garage on top of it if you don't want to pay 60 dollars for hotel parking. 
That parking is self and for 24 hours it is 46 USD. 
Rooms are a bit small but comfortable. 
Good location to core power yoga and running if that is your thing.The hotel was nice, came with free parking for staying there. 
The staff was very accommodating. 
The shower was amazing. 
However, the sink drain was broken, the toilet had difficulty flushing. 
We booked for 2 Queens, but the beds were clearly Full. 
The room wasn�t soundproof so we could hear any yelling and cars outside, so sleeping was difficult. 
The curtains also didn�t close all the way in our room so we had light we didn�t want. 
For the price, things like this should not have been an issue. 
I understand that the location of the hotel isn�t anyone�s fault and noise is noise, but then at that point is shouldn�t be so much for not having the basics we expected.Excellent hotel in a great Gold Coast location! 
Not lavish but not overpriced, either. 
Staff is nice, great little bar in lobby, and the restaurant for breakfast is good. 
Rooms are quirky, colorful and quiet -- not the same-old same-old. 
Only down side was the bathroom. 
Teeny tiny -- no place to put your stuff and weird shower set-up. 
Otherwise, thumbs up!
Hotel Indigo is my favorite place to stay downtown. 
Aside from the great location to many Chicago attractions, it is also many comforts and amenities that make a several day trip away from home very comfortable. 
The rooms are very clean, comfortable, and decorated in a way that sets it apart from many other hotels. 
The hotel staff is very courteous and helpful each time we stay. 
My only complaint would be that the parking at the hotel is quite expensive and it takes the valet drivers a long time to get your car to you. 
We definitely add 15 min to our planned schedule every time we choose to park here. 
The hotel itself is always exceptional.I've stayed at this hotel twice within 12 months, and I would go back there any time! 
The staff at the front desk are very courteous, the rooms are very "colorful" and clean. 
I've got only good memories with this hotel. 
If you're an early bird, Lake Michigan is only a couple of blocks away to take a walk for a beautiful sunrise, but also North Michigan Avenue is in perfect walking distance. 
If you don't have breakfast included, go out, take a left and on your left side (same building / block) there's a place called "3rd Coast Cafe" an awesome place for breakfast!
It's a great hotel. 
I stayed for a medical school interview in the area. 
It's not super fancy but has everything you would need during your trip. 
The staff was accommodating, kind, and helpful. 
The room I stayed in was clean and spacious and everyone was really professional. 
There's a bar, spa, and restaurant. 
I didn't really take part as I was not in town for long but would definitely come back to this hotel if I'm in Chicago again.We booked this through an Airline to receive eventual points for our stay. 8 months later we never were given our advertised points by the hotel. 
The room was small but, very clean. 
There was a long, slow, and tedious check in process which resulted in many people standing for hours. 
I had asked about an early check in prior to booking and was told no problem however; I still had to wait when I arrived and was not allowed to check in early. 
I ordered a brownie sundae from the kitchen which took forever. 
In fact it was 40 minutes even though the restaurant was empty and there were only two patrons eating at the counter. 
By the time I got it the ice cream was melted. 
The location was great but, I'd look harder for something else next time.Location fantastic! 
Room overlooked Lincoln park. 
Close to great eats and bars. 
Fantastic check-in staff, personable and full of life. 
Not your typical boring fake nice. 
Valet quick and easy. 
Room neat and clean. 10 out of five stars!
Had a very nice overnight stay. 
Room was cute: very nicely decorated, contemporary, clean, everything you needed, nothing you didn't. 
The heating unit, however, was very loud and squeaky in our room. 
We weren't able to run it at night because it was so loud. 
That aside, I really liked it. 
The hotel was located right next to the zoo and waterfront. 
Great restaurants nearby. 
I would go back againClean and comforting. 
Staff members were welcoming, conversational, and hooked us up with an upgrade without being asked! 
The rooftop bar is a great place to have a few adult beverages with some amazing views of the city and lake to bask in.The front desk people were just very lovely & the cleaning staff are very sweet & helpful. 
The beds however, are not the comfiest. 
Plus when we were done for the night & going to bed the tv kept cutting out, remote wouldn't work. 
Plus didn't even have half the stations listed. 
You can hear the toilets from other rooms as well whole you try to sleep. 
Other than that pretty nice.Valet service at the door, front desk is extremely friendly. 
The hotel itself is dated but charming. 
Rooms could be a little bigger but not a problem, watch the shins on the bed as the mattress doesn't fit the platform bed.The rooms are adequate, but small. 
The hotel is in need of an upgrade and their is no elevator. 
The swimming pool was clean and tidy. 
The breakfast definitely left something to be desired, there were very few choices which made accommodating allergies difficult. 
My family and I visit this area several times a year and most likely will not return to this hotel.Beds were stiff. 
Sheets were stained. 
Room had a strong chemical smell from the cheap cleaner. 
But overall it was fine. 
Hot shower, AC worked, continental breakfast was decent. 
Cheap hotel.The room'a heat was on when I arrived. 
It's August. 
Took quite awhile to cool off, but slept well when it finally was cool. 
The free Continental breakfast was underwhelming.Good value, clean updated room, easy access to the hotel, great local restaurants in Manteno, basic continental breakfastStaff was unfriendly except for james. 
The room smelled of mildew, the sink did not work and the tv was an old model that looked like it was going to blink off at any minute.  
I have been here many times but never had an awful experience like this.It was an absolutely amazing weekend. 
The hotel is beautiful and the staff are simply amazing. 
The concierge upgraded our room from 2 full to 1 king. 
Probably to benefit the many guests that were coming in for the game, but I was upgraded for free all the same. 
The bell service and valet were also amazing. 
The hotel restaurants were all pretty expensive and had a dress code, so we did not go to them. 
Although, they do have a place called the Market. 
It is more like a store than anything. 
You can purchase bagels and sandwiches as well as bottled beverages and much more. 
They also serve hot drinks like coffee and chia latte. 
As well as cold blended beverages for the iced coffee lovers. 
I will be staying here at any and all future Chicago visits. 
Well done Hyatt Regency Chicago staff!!!
Rooms were clean and location was great but one employee ruined the fun vacation atmosphere that we were looking to keep going. 
When we were going to leave we had our bags held in a luggage area until we were ready to head to the airport. 
I only had my Card on me and after using cabs and tipping door men, I had no cash left. 
The bag man gave us a very rude and degrading tone when we got our bags and I apologized for not having cash. 
He still continued to be upset and was not courteous at all. 
My girlfriend became upset and the more I thought about it I was upset too. 
I'm sure he gets paid hourly and gets tipped a majority of the time. 
Tipping isn't mandatory and all he did was take our ticket and we spotted our luggage. 
Just because he's unhappy and a bag man doesn't mean he literally had to be a D-BAG!!! 
11/05/17. 
The time was 3:30pm.When I first purchased this hotel I was unsure about how it would be. 
It had 4/5 star rating but had never been to Chicago before. 
When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. 
Not only was it gorgeous but it was huge and had different places to get food and there was a convention center under the building where a meeting was happening. 
The staff was super helpful and even upgraded us which was incredibly appreciated and kind of them. 
It made me extra happy to stay here. 
Our room was beautiful and had a view of the river but was also high enough that it was quiet and felt private. 
The only down side that I could find is that the restaurants are very expensive and looked like they were amazing so I left each time to get food. 
Other than that, a great stay and hoping to stay there in the future.I wasn't staying there as an overnight guest, rather I was there for a three-day conference. 
The hotel is absolutely huge. 
The first floor seems to have lots of restaurants and bars in a big open space. 
There are multiple Towers to this hotel expanding across streets. 
Our conference was down on the third floor below ground level. 
Conference facilities seem to adequate but nothing to write home about. 
The catering they had for the conference was decent. 
I would consider staying there as a guest, I'm sure the rooms are nice. 
Prime location right of the river off of Wacker Drive.Here the Becker Health IT Summit.Hotel staff was amazing when I checked in. 
He was patient, accommodating, and welcomed me. 
Alvin in security was engaging and helpful when I asked him for directions. 
He engaged me in conversation and even asked how Houston was doing, extending his thoughts and prayers. 
This will be my go to tho it's expensive. 
However, worth every cent of comfort valueI had the skirt steak. 
It was presented very well and had good flavor.. 
A couple of suggestions. 
I would slice the steak before serving and suggest it be cooked medium for maximum tenderness. 
Also the Third Star sign should be more elegant. 
With these suggestions and a small candle for each four top I would give it 5 stars!
Staff was friendly, professional and quick. 
Gym was nice, full of machines, and clean. 
Wish the rooms had refrigerators instead of coolers although there is an option to call and have the service provided for a refrigerator, but i did not want to put forth the effort. 
Walking bridge to the convention center is perfect. 
Room service always came earlier than estimated (a plus when you're hungry). 
Enjoyed my stay.Average hotel, annoying that doors don't close behind you all the way when you leave the room, have to pull them shut, house keeping did a poor job cleaning up and 2 days in a row couldn't think to remember bringing more shampoo and body wash. 
Lastly the third star restaurant has good food but service in both of our tries there was slow and sloppy with the staff forgetting our requestsNice hotel if staying near the conference center. 
The room was clean and had nice amenities. 
Great shower. 
Hotel restaurant had good food but was expensive and not much else around the hotel. 
Not close to the city center.This is a great hotel if you're in town for a conference at the McCormick center. 
The hotel is directly across the street from the center. 
The rooms are spacious and the staff is very accommodating. 
You're a short ride from downtown and there are many options for food in the area. 
I would definitely stay here again.Rooms were nice enough. 
Shower took a very long time to get warm. 
The front desk was extremely helpful and the location was great. 
Overall we had a positive experience and would recommend this hotel to others.Room was so hot unbearable.  
Window opened but no screen. 
To get in to bathroom had to step up.  
Bath doors hit toilet. 
Not good for 93 year old. 
Small small  room. 
Coffee maker in room did not work. 
Not worth the price paid.Tiny room, entire hotel smells musty & the �free wi-fi� is spotty at best & requires one to log in repeatedly. 
The �breakfast� is pathetic, fortunately there are many good meal options within walking distance in this charming area of Chicago. 
Also be forewarned, do not let your roommate flush the toilet while you are in the shower for fear of becoming scalded!
Great costumer service David was such a great help but have to say the place kind of old fashion. 
Parking is a bit pricey tooOur room was large and comfortable. 
The desk staff was helpful and professional. 
We requested a fridge brought into our room and they accommodated. 
The location was convenient for seeing Blue Man Group, Lincoln Park, and Wrigley Field.It's a 3 star hotel so expect 3 star quality or lack there of.  
Location is great though!   
One staff member was really nice and upgraded us to at top floor suite which we were so grateful for.  
But carpets are pretty dingy with spots all over.  
That was the extent to our good customer service.  
Everyone else was just okay.This isn't a five star hotel however the location is great. 
I would say this is actually the perfect location because everything is walking distance from the hotel. 
The staff members were not excellent just alright. 
The cleaning service was great. 
The room was alright but not great. 
The bathroom does need some work. 
Overall because the location was perfect I would not say this hotel was horrible because it wasn't as bad as other people said. 
But I probably wouldn't book this hotel again unless there was a promotion going on and the prices were better.As I read the reviews I was utterly perplexed.  
I found the Inn of Chicago a fantastic little "find" in the heart of everything.  
The lobby was warm and welcoming, the staff was cordial and friendly, the room was spotless and nicely decorated, the bed and linens were clean and crisp, the location PERFECT.Besides the tattered carpet in the hallways, this place well above what I expected and a steal for the price.  
The SkyView Terrace was an unexpected surprise.  
I don't know if others have either unreal expectations, inexperience in travel, or just like to complain; I just don't see it.  
Hopefully I'll get the same rate the next time I stay, and I WILL DEFINITELY STAY AGAIN!
Thanks for a great couple nights.  
Dad and DogI stayed 3 nights.  
The price was decent, $122. 
Rooms were nice and clean. 
Bed was comfy. 
Service was good.  
No soda machines that I saw. 
Ice on every floor.    
Elevators are small and slow.The location is great. 
Goto spot hero app for parking. 
The hotel charges $55, I paid $22 for a garage a block away.   
Overall, a nice place to stay at a decent price.This place was super comfy.  
I slept so well.  
It was cozy and a bit small but really really clean and the staff was super nice.  
If want to enjoy a hotel trip others may have more offer BUT if you are trying to enjoy the city this is an AMAZING spot.Great location, the service is great and very friendly, but the rooms are not as I expected. 
They are run down, looks dirty in some cases. 
I expected a impecable room for the price and location.Update(a day later) Today I walked into my room and found a beautiful note apologizing for the room and letting me know that there is another room ready for me If I wish to change.This is an excellent service that could be consider the wow factor. 
Great service and recognition is hard to find.Thank you for response and taking the time to consider my post as a suggestion for improving the experience of staying at a nice hotel.When we first arrived at the Intercontinental, we were warmly greeted by Will, the bellhop.  
He greeted us with a smile and his warm and friendly demeanor.  
He not only started our stay off right, but anytime I ran into him, he would take the time to have a conversation with me.  
We checked in and were greeted by the nicest people at the front desk.  
Unfortunately our room was not ready, so we went to the bar while waiting for friends to arrive.  
I went back a while later and spoke with Billy B., who was the such a  pleasure to speak with.  
He inquired about our room and got us checked in faster than what I thought it would be.Next up was Keenan who brought our bags up to the spacious, clean room.  
Keenan is the coolest!  
Anytime I ran into Keenan during our stay, he greeted me with a huge smile and never forgot my name.  
No matter what I asked for, Keenan made sure to get any request fulfilled immediately, even when i told him not to hurry.  
It was raining the day we checked out, and Keenan  literally held an umbrella over me while we waited for our Uber.The room, the service and smiles we received from the Intercontinental staff made our experience a truly wonderful one and we will definitely be going back to stay.  
The rooms were super clean, the beds and pillows were just like being at home and the cleaning service was impeccable. 
Will, Billy B., and Keenan are truly wonderful, classy gentleman and I'm looking forward to my next stay because of them.Great service at the front desk. 
There was a long line, but they were fast and efficient. 
Rooms are very clean and surprisingly spacious. 
A few bar options that have great atmosphere. 
Both quiet laid back scene and then the Michael Jordan bar is a loud, fun scene. 
Great location in the city with lots of shopping and restaurant options.Beautiful hotel with amazing service. 
From Amanda at registration to Calvin the doorman, every employee offers the friendliest service and is helpful in every way. 
The room was clean and spacious with fabulous city views. 
Don't forget to check out the chocolate bar in the lobby.Great staff who really stepped up and took care of me when I had some room issues! 
On top of that, the building itself has an amazing pool that's been maintained with its great art deco character. 
Will definitely be back!
One of the best hotels available. 
Very helpful staff. 
Great in room variety of alcohol, beverages, and snacks. 
The pool and exercise room hours aren't abbreviated. 
I loved the comfortable bed. 
Quiet rooms.Love this hotel because of it's location and how close it is to everything. 
You can walk to Navy Pier to the East or walk to the river to the West and North. 
So many great restaurants in the area as well. 
Rooms are a nice size and are updated and the beds are comfortable. 
Staff is wicked helpful and the lounge area is a welcome perk after a long day. 
No views from the rooms as it's pinned between two buildings but that doesn't stop it from being a great hotel that I try to stay at every time I'm in town.Rooms are great. 
Spacious, nice decor, bathroom is huge! 
Check-in was a bit frustrating as they didnt have a chip card reader yet so issues with payment. 
Location is pretty central. 
Valet is way too expensive. 
For $300/night room valet should not cost $69.Beautiful and comfortable stay.  
The room was phenomenal.  
The staff and their service and manners were inspiring.   
Highly recommended!
Great location near a lot of great shopping and dining. 
Room was spotless. 
Service is very good as well.It's a nice place, nice people, but where we are, we barely get a TV signal and can't use the satellite due to being buried in trees. 
Also, we're not able to use the Internet for some reason though the signal is good.  
The dog park is covered in dog poo because people haven't picked up after their dogs, which is annoying.  
There's a nice game room and laundry room. 
The little store isn't way overpriced, so that's good.  
In general, it's a really decent, pretty place.Would like to say this campground is the worst, so there would always be open sites for the spouse and I.   
However in all fairness to Rob and his Staff,   i must say this is one truly great campground.   
All the sites are 4 star and most 5 star.    
Fills up on weekends, so make reservations.   
They have hay wagon rides,  kids barrel train rides, and movies on the weekends.     
Also has a small general store, with  a pool, and  coin laundry room.   
i have met numerous campers there and every one was polite and friendly,  pet friendly wit a large fenced dog run.   
Any type of site your looking for,  its here, from tenting to huge motor homes,  with electric, water and sewer on about half the lots.Restrooms and showers looked clean and renovated. 
Also in offer for the K9 travel companion is an fenced in little dog park. 
Staff is friendly and accommodating. 
Definitely a nice place.The campground itself was fine. 
But it was very loud. 
Lots of foul language on the playground and basketball court. 
Not a place to really relax or take young children. 
Campground staff was informed of the rowdy behavior and foul language.  
We put up with it for 24 hours. 
They did nothing. 
I finally told the foul mouthed people to stop myself . 
Probably will not go back.First time camping in our camper.  
The owner helped us with leveling, and making sure that we were good to go.  
He taught us a lot.  
He also let us borrow a 30 amp cord, so that we could plug in.  
Kids loved the basketball court and the pool.   
They also have a movie shack.  
The kids liked the ride on the barrel rides.  
It was the perfect place for us to "test" our camper.   
We could not get our heater to work and the owner knew of another person staying there that worked on campers.  
He got the heater going in no time. 
We have also stayed here with a tent in previous years.  
Staff is very friendly.  
We will visit again.Peaceful and quiet place. 
Bed was comfortable and clean room. 
Friendly staff. 
Best part  low price. 
Loved it.Cheap and best place very impressed with this place very warm welcoming would recommend more people to go check it out .This place is horrible. 
They have druggies living there, the rooms have bugs. 
Never ever again.Not a good place to go. 
Got heroin addicts living there.Nice quiet,clean, affordable place.Will be back.We were greeted by very friendly doormen and lobby staff. 
They got us checked in very quickly and gave us details on lobby drinks, snacks, and bar hours. 
The room was clean and tidy, albeit a little smaller than most chain hotel rooms. 
The bed was very comfortable, the TV nice and big, and the bathroom was very modern and nice. 
Water pressure in the shower was probably the best I've ever had in a hotel. 
We loved the 12:00 check out time. 
This allowed us plenty of time to load up in the morning. 
My only knock on the hotel is that you can hear things outside the room quite easily. 
For example, we could hear the shower running in the room above us. 
We could also faintly hear the people talking next door. 
Overall, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
The location is wonderful - close to restaurants, coffee, shops, and within walking distance of Grant Park.Rooms are nice but bathroom is small.  
Definitely only one person getting ready at the same time.  
Beautiful lobby and stylish room.  
Free happy hour drinks.  
Great staff.  
Good location.I stayed at the Allegro for my brother's wedding at a nearby facility. 
The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful/resourceful. 
I arrived there a little after 1 and was concerned about an early check in because check-in is at 3 p.m. 
When I went to the front desk and gave them my name for the reservation, I was given a hotel key immediately. 
The room was very clean and nice. 
I really loved the decor. 
Checkout was quick and painless as well. 
The staff is very efficient and I tip my hat to management. 
I would definitely recommend their hotel. 
I will definitely stay here the next time I am in Chicago.Nice atmosphere. 
Room was relatively small, bathroom was crammed into the room. 
Undersized tub. 
Faucet was not tall enough for the wash basin, could barely get a glass under it to full with water for drinking, and it was difficult to properly wash hands under it. 
One elevator was not working, causing long wait times for the elevators. 
Location was fantastic, close to the train station, and right next door to the Cadillac theater where we went to a show.Boutique hotel in Chicago's theater district. 
Well appointed albeit smallish rooms. 
Definetely a somewhat glamorous retro vibe. 
Nice meeting and conference spaces and services. 
All gender rest room in common or public areas. 
Free coffee and tea in the mornings and a wine reception in the late afternoon. 
Many amenities done tastefully. 
Very helpful staff.We stayed at Hotel Monaco this past weekend and it was everything we needed. 
Our room was cozy and the service is outstanding! 
However if I could rate the in-room massage experience it would be a 2. 
The massage therapists arrived 15 minutes late to start, and I left in more pain than before I started. 
The therapists performed very little of the deep tissue we paid for, instead taking it upon themselves to perform multiple chiropractic maneuvers that they certainly should not have been performing. 
Do NOT waste your money on this painful experience. 
I did not want my rating to affect the hotel in any way because the hotel and our room itself was exceptional.Friendly staff. 
Large sized, nicely decorated rooms with queen beds. 
Clean bathrooms and large closet. 
Bathrobes..nice touch. 
Very comfortable chaise. 
Restaurant has fresh, good food at reasonable prices for an expensive downtown hotel. 
Only negative was view of parking lot.Stayed here for one night after flying into o'hare. 
Really nice staff. 
Wine hour is a nice touch: 5-6pm. 
Most of the rooms have huge cozy window seats about four feet off the ground. 
Makes you feel like a kid looking down over the river. 
Highly recommended.This hotel was great and I'm not quick to hand out 5 star reviews. 
Bed was comfy. 
Views were amazing g. 
Window seats were cool place to sit and watch the city. 
Sign up for their rewards and they give you 10 bucks to raid the mini bar or the bar in the hotel.We stayed at this hotel for our anniversary and loved it! 
Very clean and nice size rooms. 
The hotel is also is a very convenient location.This hotel is gorgeous!! 
My favorite Kimpton property in Chicago. 
The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms feature a stunning bar wood door with a mirror, huge showers, plenty of space to move about. 
The gym is really nice and fully functional for business travelers and there is a pool as well! 
Both are located on the top floor with expansive views of the city. 
Meeting space is lovely and flexible. 
The wrap around terrace makes such a difference. 
The chandeliers are my favorite feature.Stayed here for the Chicago marathon and I couldn't rave any more about this place if I tried! 
Staff were amazing. 
The amenities were on point. 
Most comfortable beds and such a central location. 
Also the hotel restaurant is top notch too!
rooms were a little small but we knew that going in. 5 stars for what it is!!! 
everything was clean. the windows opened, bed and pillows comfy, big enough shower, chill staff, a/c functional, slightly tacky but kinda adorable decor. again, everything was very clean and functional. modern decor. what else do you want in an affordable hotel downtown really?
Love Kimpton hotels and this one did not disappoint. 
Friendly and professional staff. 
Start off with the valet welcoming us as though we were old friends. 
Next, we meet up with the desk clerk and she was super friendly and totally excited for why we were visiting Chicago. 
Our room was wonderful. 
Great style, very spacious and awesome floor to ceiling windows. 
Location is great too. 
We were a short walk or Uber ride from where we wanted to go. 
Will definitely stay here again!
Great location.    
Staff was super friendly.    
The drinks at the bar attached to the hotel were excellent and were better than lots of other places around the hotel.   2 min walk to shopping.   
Would definitely stay again.This place was very nice, friendly helpful, and clean.  
When me and my family went to have dinner at the Sullivan's steakhouse around the corner, they called and told the restaurant a heads that we were coming and gave us priority seat and a free appetizer ?? 
the Staff was always helpful and available. 
They have a nice gym area. 
I love the art that's in the building. 
Overall I enjoyed my stay?
P.S.For all those people who just wipe the seat down and then sit on public toilets,  please stop that!!!! 
Even the cleanest looking toilets will welcome the dirtiest guest and all of their bugs and nastiness!!!!
This is by far the best Hotel experience I have ever had in my life. 
From the moment I arrived to check out, I could not have asked for better experience. 
Spencer from the front desk was very charming and made me feel welcome. 
The ambiance of the hotel is very modern and hip, great happy hour, location is amazing and the rooms were clean and spacious. 
I was having a horrible trip to Chicago and would have never guessed that  hotel stay could have completely turned my trip to be great.Came here for theater with friends. 
Hotel is wonderful, great location, great food at happy hour and super bartenders.  
Gerry Medina went above and beyond to assist us with all of our needs the entire stay. 
Ravi the doorman was always helpful, smiling, and of great assistance. 
Highly recommend this hotel. 
Quiet and classy with excellent service.Very accommodating and helpful. 
Close to shopping, sites, amd restaurants. 
Easy check in and check out/valet for business. 
The view was literally into a business about twenty feet from me with the curtains broken on my end. 
I got to see how a design firm runs quite intimately. 
It wasn't a big deal to me but it was the only negative.Excellent location, and atmosphere. 
Very cleaned and silenced hotel. 
The hospitality it's awesome and the offer you free drinks for the afternoon from 5to 8 pm. 
The breakfast is offered at every hotel floor to enjoy in your room. 
It's a continental breakfast. 
I will come back.Nice quiet property, clean rooms, LOTS of TV channels, micro-fridge in room, all ground floor, friendly mgr(lLori), will stay again next trip through.The room was very clean also i had left my cellphone on the bed and the owner called my company to inform i had left it needless to say i got my phone back thanxWe stayed one weekend night in the fall. 
The room appeared to be either new or it was recently renovated. 
Plenty of power outlets and charging ports in the room for our numeral mobil devices. 
The shower is hot and strong. 
Breakfast is included. 
I don't mind that they checked everyone against their list to make sure only registered guests get to enjoy the breakfast for free. 
The hotel does not own any parking facility, but there is a public parking garage next door. 
Due to the garage and hotel are on an one way street, you will need to drive around two blocks from hotel to the garage. 
Walking from hotel to garage however only takes a few steps.Location was great. 15 minute walk to millennium park. 
The rooms were in great shape very clean. 
Really appreciated the free WiFi. 
Also had free breakfast, which was quite good. 
Staff was very friendly. 
Self parking was very close but pretty price. 
The great price we got on the room made up for it!
Amazing experience. 
The room is was fantastic, modern fixtures and vibes. 
The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, bringing bags to the room, giving directions, etc. came here with our cats and had no issues. 
The price was amazing as well! 
Perfect location. 
I would come back in an instant!!
Good rates for Chicago. 
They remodeled and there is no longer a hot tub or pool. 
This changed since I booked and was a surprise to me when I checked in. 
I booked here for the price and hot tub. 
Otherwise, remodeling does look good. 
Breakfast is smaller now, too. 
Very limited compared to before.This was a great hotel to stay at for our weekend in Chicago. 
It was very nice, the street it is on was really quiet - something I wouldn't have expected in Chicago! 
The staff were great. 
Breakfast was really good. 
We would certainly stay here again!
We booked a room here and the people were all so friendly. 
The lady running the front desk and the maintenance guy Richard was great anytime we needed something they were there to help. 
I recommend to anyone to stay here.  
Thank you again La Quinta for a great stay.I stayed here for 2 days for a job orientation. 
The staff was friendly and very helpful including the van drivers. 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, because the housekeeping could have been a little more thorough with their room cleaning. 
Overall it was a pleasant experience.The staff was very nice and accommodating. 
That was the best thing about my stay here. 
First problem, key cards had to be swiped often before they worked. 
There was barely enough lighting to get dressed for the wedding. 
The door would not close unless you manually pulled it shut. 
The full length m mirror was partially covered by the dresser and a chair. 
I tried to call the lobby, but I couldn't because the phone didn't work. 
Told the front desk, it never got fixed. 
Breakfast was okay. 
When checking out the front desk asked how was my stay. 
I related all my complaints and they refunded my money for the room. 
I wasn't expecting that.I'm going to start with the positive,front desk staff was very pleasant. 
Continental breakfast was a plus, although it could use a better selection, beds were so so. 
The Bad - Housekeeping is not that great. 
There was hair and crumbs and dust visible on the mattress and night stand *UGH*. 
I stayed 3 nights, and every morning the same breakfast, by the 3rd day I was no longer interested. 
The 1st room I was given, the toilet wouldn't flush, the 2nd room, I found a 'bug' in the mattress (I always check), however I wasn't sure what bug it was, but wasn't staying to find out, again I was moved to a room that resembled the others. 
I feel like for all this I should have at least been upgraded. 
If I wasn't so tired, and booked with a 3rd party, I would have left and stayed elsewhere. 
The final room was fine, but all in all I honestly feel like I paid way too much to stay here. 
I originally tried to get into the holiday inn, but they were booked. 
I personally do not think this hotel is 3 stars, more like 2. 
Between the dogs, cats, poor housekeeping, rooms that desperately need to be updated and rowdy crowd on Saturday, I definitely will not be staying here again.I enjoyed my stay. 
The room was clean and good sized. 
Breakfast was good, but not extensive. 
The staff was all kind and helpful. 
Adam Smith 1507047814Was in town for business.  
Stayed at this place for a week.  
Nice new rooms, clean beds, towels etc.  
From what I am being told, they have renovated this place inside out and lobby reno is in progress. 
Would definitely recommend this place if someone is looking for clean new rooms and a friendly staff.  
Gerry was amazing and helped us with local food options and places to go nearby. unnati1287 1507055729Nice, clean and remodeled rooms! 
The new rooms look fantastic. 
Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. 
I would highly recommend this place to stay. 
Mike Phillimore 1505701249Staying here for a couple of nights for work.  
Lots of construction,  1st room I went too had not been cleaned, 2nd room AC not functioning, finally got into a room after 1/2 hour run around.  
Staff are good.  
We have a corporate account and direct billing,  and this is the first time we required a credit card for a $100 damage deposit at a La Quinta.   
Guy sleeping in parking lot in his car all afternoon and night is interesting. 
Stacey McClane 1509185182Very clean comfortable room! 
Price was great! 
Staff is friendly. 
Convenient Location. 
Will visit again. 
Bhavin Vashi 1507050551Great price. 
Looks to have gone through a renovation. 
The new rooms look fantastic. 
Would stay again.Needs a little more updated far as bathroom. 
BREAKFAST WAS HORRIBLE!! 
No scrambled eggs, no meat, waffle/pancakes mix was watery. 
My daughter said they need some whipped cream. 
Beds are the  only GOOD thing about this place and of course the price. 
Thank god it was for one night ?.
This place is beyond great! 
We stopped just for a night.... 
Their "Continental" breakfast is crazy good. 
Make your own pancakes and waffles.... 
Staff is SUPER friendly... 
Rooms affordable and clean!!! 
Will definitely come back!!!!!
Bathroom had dirt and garbage on the floor, and cigarette burns on the sink and bathtub but the staff was accommodating the bed was decent. 
Wouldn't come back though. 
They only got a 3 star because the staff was nice. 
I can't handle a dirty bathroom. 
It made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the room.I stayed at this hotel for 2 days while scouting out the area for move-in ready apts.  
Here's a rundown of some points that could be important to you as a guest:Cleanliness:  The room was generally clean, though the bathroom had indications of mold damage and subsequent mitigation.  
The linen and towels were clean and smelled the same and were in good condition.  
The floor looked worn but was free of debris.  
The fridge and coffee maker were also quite clean.Staff:  The staff was quite friendly and the highlight of the stay.  
They helped point me in the right direction in looking for places in the area and were helpful whenever I had a room request.  
Amenities:  The hotel does have an exercise room, a decent breakfast spread (think boiled eggs, yogurt, muffins, bagels, waffles and pancakes), and outdoor pool (seasonally available, of course) and quite a few entrances so you can park your vehicle close to your room.  
Some rooms (like mine) came with a fridge and microwave.Premises:  The hotel is next to I-65 & Rte 30, so road noise can get a bit loud.  
The air conditioning unit passes through the exterior wall so all that noise comes in through it.  
In addition, the window is not very soundproof, so you can hear quite a bit of road noise.  
There is a hospital nearby so I also heard sirens intermittently during the night. 
Anecdotally, some people decided to have a party right outside my window from 8pm - 2am and were obnoxious.  
They drank excessively, threw bottles into the nearby wooded area, and decided to use the restroom outside despite being within 100ft of their room.  
The second night I stayed I had a chatty guest decide to talk to everyone in the hall and let their pet run through the hallway until 1:30am.  
Unfortunately the staff couldn't do anything about the unruly guests.Finally, I'd like to add that the area around this hotel is a bit seedy.  
There are a number of 2 star hotels in the area and a vacant gravel lot nearby.  
This can't be helped by the hotel, but during my stay I was concerned my vehicle would be broken into or vandalized.  
In the end nothing happened so take it for what it's worth.Not bad for a one night stay. 
Wouldn't recommend long stay here. 
Breakfast needs improvementThis is a family owned park situated on a 100 acre farm in a beautifully wooded area. 
Partial hook ups only. 
But the ability to have a site close to the woods, and nowhere near anyone else. 
Idyllic setting. 
No dog park, but there was a HUGE mown meadow near my campsite where my Doberman could run. 
Wished I could have stayed longer.I took a day trip here with a friend as I couldn't find a lick of info on this campground on the net. 
This park has been around for many years. 
It took me a few moments, but I recognised it. 
At one time I camped there with the parents and it sported a full out camp store and mini golf. 
The place was booming.Since the original owners retired, their kids scaled the campground back. 
The camp store is closed for the foreseeable future and the mini-golf is no more. 
All the sites in this grandpappy park are still there.Seasonal sites are at the front of the campground around a small pond and weekender sites are spread all the way back to the Kankakee. 
The shower-house and bathrooms are still available as is the rec hall from what the owner told me.The park winds around a farm and a pond at the front and then eventually coils into  the woods of the Kankakee river front. 
Some roads are gravel and on approach to the river front (and the boat ramp) turn to mostly dirt and are quite a bit rougher.Sites vary from sunny to partial shade and then eventually full shade as you progress further in the park. 
Most sites are grass, pretty spacious, with water and electric on posts. 
Sites have picnic tables available. 
Firewood is available at the office. 
I would imagine the fishing would be great there.I did not spot anywhere to swim.This park is unique in that the sites that are half way to the river-front are really surrounded by thick woods, yet still have electric/water... but are not over-developed by any means and progressively get more primitive as you approach the river.Plan accordingly and call ahead. 
The owners were very pleasant when we spoke, but their focus is more on their farm then the campground hence the fact that they simply don't advertise much. 
Many of their campers are "next gen" return customers. 
They do have a sign posted that read "no tents."
This does not apply to tent trailers (pop-up) campers which seem to be ideally suited for most of their sites.This is a simple campground that's pretty dated, but there is enough interest for me (as a place to get some peace and quiet on a weekend)  to return to this park and post a more detailed review later.Campers and employees are great. 
Management leaves a little to be desired. 
A great place for adults to camp. 
To much parties for kids and parks and playgroup not kept up at all.Over all nice place . 
My only complaint is that everyone owns a golf cart and their is to many minors driven them like its a Indy 500 track. 
The one time I went there a inncdent occurred where some kids hit a younger child walking by. 
I would hope staff will get more strict on the golf carts. 
If not I probably won't be heading back there. 
I'm going back this weekend to give it another shot if I see those carts flying around. 
I will bring it up to managements attention and if I see nothing is done i will not be returning there again. 
I will update on this post .The pools are nasty cloudy.  
I think the lake is cleaner than the pools. 
The water slide is not maintained.  
My son said he had to physically pull himself down the slide,  because the slide wouldn't slide him to go down on his own. 
They have really cheap kayaks with canoe paddles instead of kayak paddles. 
The beach is nice though.  
I'd update my review if they maintain thier facility better.  
Great place to own or rent a camping site. 
Lots to do. 
Camping, swimming, bbq, crafts, walking, waterslide, recreation hall, outdoor movie ampitheater, concerts, dances, arcade,  basketball, tennis, a few playgrounds, and more. 
Pet friendly. 
Good security and everyone watches out for each other. 
My family has been coming for a few yrs now since we bought our own lot. 
The one problem we run into is, that there's not enough time in a weekend to enjoy this campground. 
I hope you enjoy your vacation here as we do.Reserved a site a month and a half in advance of our arrival.  
The full amount was charged to our credit card the day I called.  
What ever happened to a deposit? 
Place was so horrible, we left a week and a half early.  
Loud party place with nooo rules enforced!! 
Had to have air or a fan running in order to sleep at night.  
Pay attention to reviews!!
Absolutely wonderful hotel. 
Very friendly staff. 
Definitely clean. 
Breakfast was nice. 
And the doors were quiet!
After a full day of work and a 20 hour drive, we had the pleasure of sleeping next door to a room full of children. 
The second night, we were awoken by two people fighting in the hallway all night. 
Then awoken again by the cops beating on the doors. 
Then awoken AGAIN by the front desk person. 
The bed was seriously uncomfortable and the people throwing each other into our door, WORST hotel i have stayed at. 
Management was aware of the fighting and the cops, but still refused to give any sort of credit for the inconvenience of spending the weekend there and having to drive the 20 hours home to Florida with NO sleep. 
I will NEVER let anyone i know stay there.  
If you are down for midnight drunken fights and dealing with cops, go ahead, but never again will i stay in this nightmare of a hotel.This hotel is cozy and the management nice, I would stay at it again if I have to.The gym is not really a gym, but is better than nothing. 
Nice indoor pool and a decent breakfast. 
My room was clean and very comfy..Loved Magnuson hotel. 
Wanted to take bed and bedding home with me! 
So cozy!
Stayed here for a couple nights for work. 
Overall I really like the place. 
The beds are incredibly comfy and the staff are friendly. 
The breakfast is the same breakfast you'll find in most hotels. 
And the WiFi isn't the best, but it gets the job done.Great hotel. 
Great price. 
Location good but a little bit outside of center city. 
However still much in the East Lakeside neighborhood. 
Rooms fine for travel/business for one person but would be a little small for two unless just needed for sleeping.Though I expected this to be a nice, older, well kept hotel, I have found little to help me understand why my stay has been so crappy.For starters, Daniel has no business being employed by this hotel.  
He knows how to check people in and bake cookies, is friendly, but not a helluva lot else.When we arrived, the heat wasn't on in our room.  
Daniel turned on what ended up being the Air Conditioners and told us to just keep increasing the temperature on the units until it got warmer.  
We asked about the radiators and he told us they don't work and aren't used anymore.  
There was a tiny little vent on the wall with a dial and it said Heat Only.  
We used that and it was the only thing that was dispersing heat in our room.  
It was in the low 30's outside with a strong wind.  
We spent the first night and the next morning freezing.  
Daniel was supposed to tell Chris that the heat wasn't working so he could come and fix it.Daniel forgot to tell Chris and until we returned around 1:30 pm the next afternoon to see the new desk person, we didn't have any heat whatsoever.  
Chris came up within 5 minutes after we alerted the front desk that we didn't have heat.  
He told us that the AC units were AC and Daniel was wrong and that the radiators do and are supposed to work to provide the heat.Chris said he was going to turn on the radiators and come back in 45 minutes to check.  
He was here within 45 minutes and still a problem with the radiators producing heat.  
When he returned, he had two portable space heaters and they were pumping out warmth within minutes.  
Chris was wonderful, personable and deserves a raise.The best aspect of the hotel thus far has been the beds.  
They are soooooo comfortable and I got an amazing night sleep -- one of the best ever in a hotel.The cookies are a nice treat late in the afternoon.  
The continental breakfast was adequate, although there was something wrong with the hard boiled eggs as they tasted like vinegar. 
Found bugs crawling down the wall below the TV in the bedroom area of our suite.  
The bugs looked like centipedes.Overall, this hotel shows its age and needs significant remodeling to be worthy of the extremely high rates.  
Its a boutique hotel, but there are few amenities that make it qualify as a boutique hotel.Unless you can get a super deal to stay here, I don't recommend staying at this hotel.Historic hotel in a quiet neighborhood, with reasonably priced garage parking around the corner.  
Many nice restaurants within walking distance.  
An easy 6 block walk to Wrigley Field and the Addison red line train.  
Grocery store 2 blocks away.  
Friendly and helpful hotel staff. 
Hotel has 4 floors and has an elevator.  
You do go down 4 or 5 steps when you first enter the hotel.  
Our room was smaller, but very comfortable and clean. 
Nice mini bar with drinks and snacks, including a couple of $15 bottles of wine.  
Basic breakfast included... 
Cereal, fruit cups, yogurt, Danish, muffins, bagels, coffee, tea, juice, etc.For a hot breakfast walk a few blocks to Anne Sathers.First time staying here, I loved it! 
We had the sun room suite, plenty of room with a fully stocked mini bar, 2 TV's, super comfy bed. 
Within walking distance to Wrigley Field(10 min walk) Located in a quiet neighborhood. 
The staff is excellent! 
Will definitely stay again when in Chicago. 
We stayed one night here. 
We had three adults and a baby. 
Our room had two queen beds and a separate sitting room with sofa bed. 
There's a mini fridge and microwave. 
The place is definitely older but had a great look. 
We did have a sitting room carpet that was stained and looked dirty. 
It was very hot that night and our ac kept the rooms perfectly chilled. 
Cookies in a lovely lounge area were a sweet idea. 
The continental breakfast was fresh and tasty. 
Parking was the hanguo, as it was forty dollars for 24 hours and was a three block walk away. 
It was very hot out but the walk was ok. 
In the winter that would be much more difficult. 
The staff here are wonderful, helpful and friendly. 
Daniel from the front desk went above and beyond and made everyone feel welcome. 
A definite difference from the cookie cutter check in at other places and been too. 
The neighborhood is very pretty and there are shops and restaurants within reaming distance. 
Definitely a positive experience.I do not know how this hotel is ranked at 3 or 3.5 stars.  
The beds were really comfortable, but the rest ofnthe room had issues.  
First we had requested a non smoking room, it was confirmed as non smoking and yet it reeked horribly of cigarette smoke.  
There were several burn marks on the bathroom sink, so if this room is no longer a smoking room but was at one time, it needs to be overhauled cause the smell hasn't left.  
Next there was a decent sized gap next to the tub and wall that looked like it had been caulked multiple times.  
The curtains did not offer any sheers just the blackout blinds which meant either no outside light or all of it.  
Lastly we walked from the hotel to the casino, about a 5 min walk.  
Hallways were dirty, tons of dust and food were caked on the floor.As far as service and the staff if I could rate them separately I would give them a 5.  
Everyone was no nice, friendly and helpful!  
What this hotel lacks in cleanliness and upkeep it more than makes up for in its high quality staff service.  
Still I am going with a 2 rating because these other areas of opportunity are so abundant.I took my wife to the buffet on crab leg night. 
That was on 9-9-17.  
The crab legs were salty as hell.  
We didn't enjoy them at all.  
We notified the manager and she stated that the crab legs come that way.  
I will say that the fried chicken & fried catfish were good and mashed potatoes.The Majestic Star has been around for over twenty years. 
Both boats need some cosmetic improvements, but the staff.... for the most part unbelievably friendly! 
Unfortunately, the last visit to Jackpot Java was not pleasant. 
I stood in line for 10 minutes and was told they didn't have any hot dogs or polishes ready. 
Terrible! 
And was also told they run out of hot dogs all the time. 
I wasn't offered anything for my inconvience. 
Thumbs down for my last visit.The rooms are over priced, especially for Truck Drivers, two towels in a room that sleeps at least two people, when everyone knows a woman uses two towels to shower,  No fridge or microwave in the room, have stayed in cheaper motels that had fridge and microwave, the choice of coffee in the rooms is nasty,  will go back for the casino, but won't stay in the over priced motel again, very disappointedNow about the way over priced Buffet, Where was the shrimp?!!! 
Two people being charged 70 plus dollars for the buffet and one doesn't even eat crab legs is a bit much, the crab legs cooked with the crawfish and clams were NASTY!!!! 
The crab legs on the far end were cold, definitely won't be eating there again, not for that priceRoom was fairly cheap and clean. 
Our room was facing the lake, so that was nice to get to see. 
We just stayed overnight here one night on our trip to Chicago.Clean, comfortable bed and accommodation. 
Good customer service, upscale furniture and a strong heater.  
This last was needed because the steel entrance door let a steady draft in through the cracks. 
It should be weatherstripped pronto.  
The hot water in the bathtub took forever to heat up to lukewarm and never really got hot.  
Few channels available on an older style TV.Absolutely bare-bones. 
No tissues, shampoo, hairdryer. 
At least I didn't see any bedbugs. 
Room was fairly clean, but needs total renovation. 
Shower was ice cold but warmed up after 5 minutes. 
Wondered if there would still be hot water for people who woke up later.We arrived late at night (midnight) after a long day in Chicago and were poorly received by staff. 
First, we were told there was no reservation under our name. 
Then reservation was found but needed to be paid (although we paid in advance). 
Once that was solved, we were given keys to our bedroom. 
At this point it was close to 1am. 
As we entered our room, we noticed it smelled like cigarettes, there were different stains in our bed sheets and chewing gum on the carpet. 
The shower had almost no hot water. 
Overall, an incredibly frustrating experience. 
I would stay away from this place if I were you.The hotel was clean enough, and the front desk person was nice. 
The room could use a coffee maker and more towels. 
I had one each of a hand towel, bath towel, bath cloth. 
Had to go out for a cup of coffee.After driving 7+ hrs I was notified that I no longer had my reservation that I made in January at this hotel because they switched from a Days Inn to a Motel 6... 
I was NEVER notified of any changes nor that my reservation was not being honored. 
There was not a manager available and no further help was offered besides "I guess you can call corperate". 
I was also told that the switch had just happened 2 days prior and that they had completely filled all of their rooms within that time. 
The entire situation was handled VERY poorly. 
My husband and I were forced to stay at a hotel where we questioned the safety of ourselves and our belongings, however they were still more 'accommodating' than this Motel 6 in Alsip.  
Dave Mcclure 1507072258Had a really good stay the first night. 
I just wanted to thank you for being pet friendly. 
It means a lot to a lot of people out there being able to take their pets where they're welcome. 
Daniel Whalen 1506694052Unfortunately I cannot give a good review. 
The room was mediocre at best. 
The floor was so filthy the bottom of your feet would be black after walking on the floor. 
The mini fridge that I had to ask for barely kept anything cold. 
The bed was so uncomfortable I woke with a headache and back pain every day. 
There was almost no water pressure. 
And the Wi-Fi was so slow I couldn't even stream video. 
All in all this was a less than desirable experience. 
Pete Pinter 1508099419liked the wood/parkay floors in the room.  
much cleaner look and feel. 
Mychele Jackson 1502316687At first everything was fine until the next morning and I turned the light on and roaches scattered. 
I couldn't let at first because the floor is dark wood color. 
But I definitely shook all my bags out a left. 
J ADDISON 1509559087They have changed..clean room ,hard wood floors, very peaceful restThe best thing about the place was the price. 
It is almost half of any similar joints in the area. 
The other positives are the clean room, comfortable bed and available mini fridge and microwave and a good WiFi connection.Why only three star. 
Very sparse amenities. 
No closet (just hangers in open),  smallish bathroom, no toiletries except a small piece of soap., no coffee maker and coffee in lobby was bad and obviously no free breakfast. 
Overall, it is good for what you pay for and a clean and warm place to stay.Update: I am changing rating to 4* for locational convenience. 
There are multiple gas stations, Denny's, McDonald's, Pilot (excellent travel center) etc. 
Also, the motel is within a few hundred feet off highway 57. 
The conveniences you realize when you land up at 11 PM in the night and want to get something to eat or if your gas tank is almost empty.Gilman is a very small town and we stayed there when we attended a country concert at the Ford County Fair about 20 miles away.  
The motel was fine.  
Nothing too fancy but for the price it was okay.  
It is very close to eating establishments and the check in was easy and the hotel personnel was friendly.  
I think the room could have been a little cleaner for my taste, but the bed was comfortable.everything was perfect, i liked the way they had the room set up with the little table, chair etc it was clean and fresh.most motels don't have enough  electrical connections for 1 item let alone 3, and you filled the bill.I stay here whenever I come home. 
There is reason I do, they are always so very accomodating. 
I like the look and feel of the rooms. 
They have the sweetest staff.  
Always awesome!!! 
I cannot rave enough about them.I stay at motel 6 almost every weekend, and I've never had any serious issues. 
The first thing I noticed was the stale smell to the room. 
The bath towels were very yellow and paper thin, dead bugs on the floor, two moldy coffee cups in the microwave, when the vent is running in the bathroom ; it made the room smell like sewage.  
The floors were so dirty my feet were black. 
Okay, so I go in and clean (because obviously they don't) next thing, my dog starts breaking out in hives. 
So, I go out and get some benadryl as my husband gives him a bath. 
Guess what? 
Dog is covered in fleas. 
My dog is 9, and has had one flea in his life.  
I sat there and picked the fleas off, one by one and killed them. 
Tv channels are very slim pickings. 
You have a better chance of finding a channel selling sex toys (yes, it's true), than a news channel, or anything of decency for a family. 
Positives: the washer and dryer were very good (not taking fleas with me)Microwave and refrigerator in roomNever saw any live bugs on floor, besides a spider.Close to McDonald's,  burger king, dairy queen and truck stopsQuiet for the most part, but walls are paper thin.I love staying at Motel 6; the idea that you've "left the light on" for me and I will have a clean safe and affordable place to lay my head after a long day of traveling is reassuring. 
This trip was no different. 
The hotel staff at this particular motel were amazing; my husband is a cancer patient and needs certain special accommodations and the staff were so receptive and engaging. 
From the front desk to the room attendants to the guys removing trash, etc. 
Everyone was wonderful. 
Thank you again for a marvelous stay. 
We explored Chicago but came back each night for 4 nights to sleep in Hammond Indiana at Motel 6. 
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!
Toilet needed to be cleaned more thoroughly! 
Overall a great experience, although I wish the guests placed next door to us would have been put somewhere far away but I  guess you can't have your cake and eat it too  lol I would definitely recommend this for a short or extended stay. 
My puppy loved it and so did IFor the extremely low price, my stay at Motel 6 has been much better than expected. 
The computer system was originally broken when we first arrived so we had to wait an hour before we could check-in. 
However, our room is neat and clean. 
The ac works, the bed is decent, and the shower is nice. 
There is plenty of parking so we are able to park immediately outside our door. 
Staff and other guests have mostly been polite and left us alone.I really enjoy the location and easy accessibility to your hotel. 
I thought I have found that on my previous stays at this particular hotels Motel 6 that my rooms have not been thoroughly cleaned bathrooms have been found to still have hair and stains in the toilet as well as debris on the floor. 
The bathroom still have items left on the floor for the previous stay I have found that the beds the Linens haven't been changed they just been restricting found pubic hairs cigarette butts and other items left in the morning when I brought this to the attention of the person on duty she told me that there was no way that this could be happening and I actually had to check out and go and stay somewhere  else because I could not believe that she would tell me this I was lying to her and that I wasn't seeing what I was saying. 
But since then I have returned and I stayed three or four nights a week I have sent I am still experiencing rooms that are not there only being clean sweat and or mop and dust it nor are they being thoroughly  changed as far as bed linensThe room was clean on the surface. 
I left there was stain on comforter I was told to take it off no one sleeps under that anyway. 
The phone was old looked like it hadn't been cleaned in FOREVER. 
The final straw after I wiped down everything and sprayed disinfectant was the toilet. 
It had black mold around the rim. 
I Left and went to a different hotel. 
I spoke to the manager the next morning. 
She apologized i and was given a full refund.Comfortable room and bed.  
Stayed two nights in cold weather and found the accommodation warm and mostly quiet. 
Lots of TV channels to choose from.  
Had an issue with the toilet but it wasn't a showstopper.  
There was also a long shift changeover at 3 pm that delayed check in by 15 minutes.Front desk was excellent. 
Had no remote in room and he brought one down right away. 
Housekeeping not so good. 
Stayed 3 days never had any except for Sunday while we were gone someone came in took out the old towels and replaced with new ones. 
But that was all-no glasses didn't take out garbage. 
Same night at about 8pm after a long day someone came buy yelling housekeeping but I was too tired to deal with them. 
These 2 women were unbelievably noisy for the next 1.5 hours in the hall. 
I know they have a job to do but why did the first one earlier in the day not do it? 
Everything else was pretty good except that a couple of times in the hall way I definitely smelled smoke.I was definitely pleased at the price for the rooms we booked and how easy it was to reserve the rooms. 
The actual rooms were a bit disappointing- bathroom was not cleaned well, both my child and I have a foot fungus from showering in this room-bedding was worn and stainedno comp breakfastpaid for wifi  ($4.99)and was shut off after only 7.5 hours,unable to connect again after 8am ( was paid for a full 24 hours- no refund offered)puddle of urine beside toiletroom keys did not always unlock doors- doors stuck or jammed when trying to openhallways smelled like marijuanaCould hear noises from other rooms and in hallways -thin walls/no  noise barriersRoom was neat and clean including the bathroom. 
Bathroom was missing toilet paper which I got from the desk. 
No big deal. 
What bothered me was the light smell of cigarette smoke in the room. 
I am sensitive to that smell and it kind of "bothered" me during my stay especially at night.Desiree was a friendly, courteous and professional host. 
She took good care of checking us in and making us feel welcome. 
The room was clean and what we expected. 
I was surprised not see any shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom. 
And the $5 premium wi-fi kept disconnecting. 
But, overall, we enjoyed our short stay.I stayed 2 nights, Room was  clean. 
They also have Free WI - FI Internet. 
Most important they have full cable tv, not just few channels.We had no other option but to stay here after our neighbors apartment caught on fire. 
I would rate it less, if that was an option. 
Its dirty. 
The employees/ especially the owner and his wife are rude. 
We had problems with bugs. 
And we weren't allowed any company, not that we wanted any in that filthy place. 
My worst experience at a hotel/motel I've ever had.Very rude people. 
Motel has a very bad ant infestation. 
They show you no respect! 
Wifi is always down. 
Cleanliness is very questionable. 
Do not come here especially if you're visiting family because they're not allowed to visit you. 
You can not have any company.I WENT IN TO PAY FOR A ROOM FOR SOMEONE TO BE GREATED BY A VERY RUDE OWNER! 
WHEN I ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY HE WAS DOING CERTAIN THINGS DURING THE TRANSACTION HE YELLED AT ME, THREW ME A PEN TO SIGN THEN THREW ME MY CARD BACK. 
I CALLED AND TRIED TO TALK TO HIS WIFE TO INFORM HER OF HIS BEHAVIOR &,SHES JUST AS RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL AS HIM!!!!
nice and clean roomThe trailers are all spqced way to close together 10-20 ft max. 
Too cramped for my taste no escape from nosy or beligerent neighbors. 
Many of the trailers are severly aged although the park has been ripping some of them out.Loved it! 
Office ladies are adorable and fruendlyPooWe loved this campground.  
Great for kids,  so much for them to do.  
They had a blast.  
The campground is very clean and well taken care off. 
Every staff member we met was very friendly and helpful. 
They seem to really enjoy their jobs.  
Love the extra activities and themes on the weekends.  
We will definitely be back.Best thing we have done in a long time. 
It was clean and the staff was great. 
We will be back soon!
My family and I have been coming here for about 5 years now.Lot of activity�s for the kids to do. 
The website is up to date.They are strict on the rules, but I like that. 
The only reason why I gave a 4 is I feel the $15 bracelet is a little overpriced, or they should have a frequent buyer coupon for non-seasonal guest. 
Shower rooms are cleaned daily. 
Sites are big. 
Beach is nice. 
Plus you can order a pizza from town and they deliver to the campground. 
We enjoy coming here and will return.Hi We stayed at Oak Lake Family Campground August 2, 2016. 
BEWARE OF EXTRA CHARGES!!!!!!!!! 
It was a Tuesday and we were charged weekend rates $50.00, more because we were only staying one day. 
We were never told ahead of time that we would pay extra for only staying one day. 
We arrived at 11:30 and had to pay an extra $20.00 because check in was not until 3 pm.  
Then we paid $15.00 per child to use the campground lake. 
So for one day we paid $ 245.00 to stay and play.  
I would like to have known up front  about all the extra charges. 
We had to bring our own sheets and clean our cabin to get our fifty dollar deposit back. 
I will not return.This is a great family place for camping.  
As for the reviews that show a low number of stars/complaints, is there a campground you go to that you are allotted everything for free??  
I have never seen a place like that!  
If there is one let me know so I can take my family there on the cheap!  
The owners are super nice, the staff is super nice, and they do have FREE activities for the kiddos.  
The beach is wonderful and the water is great.  
Will definitely go back again!
Good things.. very close to McDonald's, metro station, all pubs are near by, all big food joints are very close.. 
Reception staff is very helpful, housekeeping is very good..For visitors - no tea or coffee machine in room, microwave is not available in all rooms.Overall rating - I m happy and recommending for the short visit.Had to switch rooms because they didnt have the cleaning done by check-in time. 
Room was clean, but pics look better than real life. 
Room was hot. 
There�s no temp control in room, you have to call front desk. 
Called front desk to see if they could turn temp down. 
They reluctantly said they would, but room felt more hot after a while. 
Husband woke up in the middle of the night overheated so he opened a window to cool down the room, but then couldn�t sleep because of the sounds from the busy street. 
Just pay the extra $50-$100 to stay somewhere nicer and up to date.This hotel seems very old looking from the outside. 
When you go into your room, it is not the newest furniture, but, the bed is very comfortable, the desk and chair are comfortable to work at with a colleague working from the big comfy chair. 
It is in a very good location of a Chicago with lots of places to visit within walking distance. 
I would stay here again on my next business trip.What a great little place to stay! 
Is older, but easy to get to, rooms are reasonable, very clean, quite & Free Parking! 
If you're not looking for anything fancy, but just clean & comfortable, I certainly recommend this place!?
First, it's a MOTEL (easy to forget) so expect motel confort. 
It's cheap, clean, relatively quiet, free parking and in the city center. 
A good deal for the price.There's no breakfast but they have a coffee/tea machine and some basic fruits. 
We had a good stay.Have a leaking water meter supposly someone is coming by today my water and under the home has lots of waterToo many rules with fines as consequences. 
Lot fee raises each year with no justification. 
Streets are bad, cannot have garage sales. 
One good thing...Neighbors are great.Clean and quiet.It's a trailer park in the midle of nowhere High standards are maintained here.nice place just plan on doing all the owners work and dont make them mad or  they will ask you  sorry tell you to leave nice christansThe owners are immensely kind, and the land is gorgeous too.  
I loved camping here and hearing whippoorwills at night, and all the songbirds in the morning.Absolutely perfect place to camp?
Loving our seasonal site??
Friendly place ?
Great Campground!! 
Nice sites!!
Enjoyed camping here. 
Quaint remote, Christian campground. 
Friendly family oriented. 
My husband and I went here for the first time for our fifth anniversary in 1994.  
It was wonderful.  
We were unable to return for 20 years.  
For our 25th anniversary we returned and were absolutely delighted to see it was exactly as we remembered.  
A third cabin had been added and the owners had built a new home for themselves but we stayed in the same cabin we stayed in for our fifth anniversary and while we have grown up and changed it was so much fun to compare the two trips.  
We were able to return one more time for my husbands birthday for a total of three trips to this wonderful place.  
Unfortunately, my husband passed away two weeks ago at the tender age of 50.  
I will treasure the memories.  
If you have a chance, come to this charming, private, memory making place for two.Just a great place to get away and spend some well needed our time !
Fantastic get away with that special someone.From the moment I walked in I was breathless..... 
My finance led me to believe we were taking back roads to bypass I-65 to head to Indianapolis for an overnight stay.  
Never in my dreams did I think she had this planned.  
What a beautiful resort.  
Your own pool, hot tub and sauna, and water bed with a mirrored canopy right in the private of your own room.  
Very spotless and if you forgot anything at home it was provided for you.  
Very nice and polite owners 'Terri and Lou' ...Couldn't ask for nicer people.... thanks Lou for the door to door directions.... 
We will definitely be back.  
I went here on my wedding night. 
It's beautiful and the owner was happy and friendly. 
I just wish the waterfall in our cabin wasn't set on a timer. 
Since our reception didn't end until 3, we didn't get to enjoy it. 
I would LOVE to go again sometime. :)Needs to be more picky on who they let inI had never stayed at a Quality Inn & Suites before but the name did not hold up. 
The room was fine, clean and neat. 
The bathroom was closet-sized. 
Beds were decently comfortable. 
Our TV was not set up right, and when we finally got it working, the signal was so bad it looked like a 16 bit video game. 
Treadmill also did not operate above a walking speed. 
However, breakfast was well stocked and the staff were friendly. 
If this experience is characteristic of the Quality Inn & Suites brand then I will certainly find a different hotel next time.We were right across the highway from Werner Park. the parking lot was kind of crowded and tight. the staff there was very friendly and courteous. 
The pool and hot tub were very nice. 
The biggest complaint that I would have was that it was supposed to be entirely non-smoking and the first smell I had in when I walked in the room was smoke. 
The morning breakfast was good but crowded also due to tight space. 
For the money it wasn't a bad place to stay but it wasn't the greatest either.My sister stays here whenever she comes to Omaha to visit. 
This last time the hotel made a booking mistake and upgraded her room for free. 
Room looked really nice. 
Front desk staff seemed really nice. 
Lobby was a little shabby.It's worn, but the bed was comfortable,the breakfast was great and the staff was super friendly. 
We did have a minor issue with the toilet and the electric outlets being scarce, but for the price it served out needs and we were comfortable.We stayed overnight as a rest on a road trip, and this hotel was great for that purpose. 
Priced well, it was definitely not a high-end hotel, but was comfortable and clean. 
The bedding and furnishings were modern, though the pant and carpet could probably use a refresh. 
Staff was very friendly (Corey, on check in was about the best I've encountered at a hotel, very helpful and genuine). 
Breakfast was good. 
Overall it was a good value and I'd stay again.I loved my neighbors, mgt was not the best but I have heard they have been replaced and it's much better now. 
Street maintenance is not the greatest though.Lived there for a while ,no community room or pool ,rent increases often for no amenity's.Amazing how the only people with time to review are the troublemakers that were recently evicted. 
This place is great and the only known drug dealer was a guy named Jason who was recently evicted. 
What a coincidence!
I have family and friends who live there and they love it, nice playground and the roads are better than most streets in town. 
It's amazing how little my friends pay to live there.Tons pot holes. 
Never fixed properly!!
The only thing that goes up is the lot rent.The tenants are bottom of the barellManagement is a joke,both are mental defectives.Pot holed streets,snow not plowed. 
This is the true example of trailer trash.This is a great hotel in the middle of everything! 
There's a nice sitting area downstairs off the lobby, a fun and modern bar/restaurant, and a nice outdoor pool with a running track around it! 
We stayed in a king bedroom with a balcony which was great. 
The floor in our room was pretty! 
The bed was comfortable, ample enough TV channels, a nice desk, a comfortable chair, and an ottoman. 
The bathroom was interesting, there were two sliding doors - one to enter the bathroom and one to enter either the shower or the toilet (it rolled back and forth between the two). 
I highly recommend asking the concierge any questions you have about the area. 
They were so helpful! 
The front desk was also helpful in anything we needed for our room!
We were celebrating my birthday in Chicago, so my boyfriend called down to ask if they had a slice of cake with a candle for a birthday...they said they didn't have a slice of cake but had something similar. 
Within 5 minutes, they came up with this beautiful small dessert with a candle and a happy birthday message on the plate. 
It was delicious!
I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely look forward to another stay. 
Thanks for making my birthday fun, exciting, and comfortable!
All of the staff members are delightful and helpful. 
The rooms are pretty and spacious. 
I love the shower head that's pointed straight down so it's similar to rain. 
The rates are incredibly fair considering the quality. 
I didn't use the indoor pool and hot tub but the outdoor pool, child pool, and hot tub are amazing. 
I recommend staying here if you ever need a hotel in this area!
Great location, excellent service. 
Attended a conference and chose this hotel as the home-base. 
Rooms are clean and comfortable. 
Staff is kind. 
Would definitely recommend to others and would like to return.I really enjoyed my time at the Radisson Blu. 
I was attending as a speaker at a conference at the hotel and was very impressed with every staff member that I encountered from the bellboys at the taxi stand all the way to the waiters and waitresses serving dinner at the event. 
I was also impressed with the catering around the event and the restaurant in the hotel which I believe is called Fellini's. 
On top of it all the architecture of the hotel is spectacular and the location perfect.This was a super nice hotel in a great spot. 
We walked from millennium station, checked it, and the walked to get dinner. 
The staff was very nice and even though we were not dressed for such a fancy hotel (we were in hoodies and jeans) they treated us no different than any one else.The location was great. 
Only 1 block off of Michigan ave. 
The room was very spacious. 
I would stay here again. 
The only cons were the room could use some updating and the elevators are tiny (not really that big of a deal though, in my opinion).Would recommend only if interested in history of hotel. 
The lobby is very small and in a constant state of chaos. 
You do receive help with your bags when you arrive. 
Only one doorman assisted with cabs. 
The bed is wonderful and the bath is beautiful. 
If you have bad knees you won't be comfortable with the rest of the furniture as it sits very low. 
The air conditioner sounds like a jet taking off. 
The kitchen light fell down and 3 days later when we left it was still down. 
Too many quality hotels in Chicago to stay here.This hotel was fantastic. 
Some of the best service I have had in any restaurant ever.  
Food was exceptional.Fantastic location with a lovely rooftop bar. 
The room was large, clean, and quiet. 
Also, for you tall travelers, they had a very tall shower and it. 
Was. 
Glorious.I have stayed in many hotels from California to New York ... this hotel was endearing and had personality but I would like to say for the 360 some dollars I spent to stay here for 1 evening (while working ) I was not happy nor was I comfortable! 
I was greeted by a pile of ants in the bathroom and after my shower I almost fell down because the entire bathroom was so slick , no exhaust fan no shower curtain so there was water flowing over the entire floor and the bed was seriously the most uncomfortable bed I have EVER slept in in my entire life !!!! 
I have worked in places all over the entire United States and this was seriously close to the worst ?. 
I NEVER write reviews but I cannot believe the amount of money I spent on this hotel and the serious lack of convenience or cleanliness was horrific.This was the worst motel we have ever stayed at. 
Zero stars.  
The beds were sagging a full foot, roaches were running around, and the tub/shower hot water had no handle.  
The shower head was shot and the tub drain cover was not attached and floated away from the drain. 
Additionally the shower walls were stained and had what looked like mold in the corners. 
The tub was also stained with rust color.  
We would have taken a different room,  had one been available. 
Someone was supposed to come over and fix the shower handle,  but never showed up. 
Luckily I had a pair of vice grips in my car. 
The bottom line is that I will never stay at another Red carpet inn. 
And will recommend the same to anyone else. 
I rated one star, only because this post would not allow me to pick zero.Overall it was decent for the price paid. 
I wish I could say it was good but essentially you get what you pay for. 
That said, the manager was very friendly and helpful.Disgusting but it was 2 am I was driving with my kids and it was raining. 
I hydroplaned a couple times so had to stop somewhere. 
Sign says $28 conveniently they didn't have a non smoking single so instead of offering a smoking one he did a double and charged $50. 
There's bugs crawling in the tub. 
TV remote doesn't work. 
Room smells. 
But like I said had to stopGreat price. 
Clean though old fixtures. 
Easy access off I 70 east of EffinghamStaff were super niceThe staff was friendly and really enjoyed the courtesy call once we were in the room for a while to make sure everything was good. 
The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. 
Thought this hotel visit would surpass my expectations. 
While sleeping in since on vacation there was construction being done on several rooms around us. 
When asked if we wanted the second or third floor we just wished that they would have advised us that the third floor has rooms being renovated. 
Missed sleep because of it.1st room we were put in was on the 3rd floor and it was horrible! 
Could smell smoke immediately even though it was smoke free. 
Then noticed a lot of things needed repair. 
Also, very tight space inside, no rroom to maneuver. 
We complained so they put us on the 1st floor which was much better. 
Still a bit tight but no smoke smell. 
This room had a large jacuzzi tub in the bathroom and it was difficult to step into it to take a shower. 
Also, slippery inside so did not feel too safe with it. 
A/C was noisy in both rooms. 
We would never stay in a Red Roof Inn again!
I stayed at Red Roof Inn and Suites Monee with my family and cats and would recommend others to stay here. 
Mostly because it's cheap and allows pets which was the main reason I liked this hotel among others. 
They had a indoor pool but I didn't get a chance to check it out. 
They also had free breakfast with a variety of options which was nice. 
The only problem I had with my stay was that to shower they gave very small bottles of shampoo and conditioner. 
I ran out with 1 shower and the rest of my family couldn't shower. 
Overall though I was happy with my stay.If I could give this place zero stars I would. 
After an entire day of traveling and driving we stopped here around 2:30 AM. 
As soon as we walked in our room you could smell smoke. 
The signs clearly say no smoking but there were newports on the trash can along with other garbage. 
The bed wasn't even fully made, you could tell someone had been sleeping there. 
Hair on the sheets, smelled dirty. 
The bathroom had a dirty rag on the counter and an open bar of soap laying on the counter as well. 
It's like someone was in here and left right before we got up to the room. 
I am completely disgustedHonestly the nicest hotel in the area. 
And it's only about 10$ more that all the other places.super clean, the pool is nice and their free breakfast is amazing. 
They have a waffle maker. 
I wouldn't stay anywhere but here in the areaAwesome hotel, and great getaway. 
My better half and I enjoyed staying here. 
Beautiful view.Shame this is now a Red Roof Inn. 
Was formerly the magnificent Richmont Hotel, and the excellent Rue Saint Clair restaurant. 
Was my go to place to bring dates to dinner back in the mid-late 80s and early 90s. 
Shame the Rue is closed  :(The location is amazing! 
Just a few minutes walk from amazing food, navy pier, and great sights to see. 
For the price, it's good. 
Some things that were a problem: the elevator is a little on the small side and it scrapes as it goes up and down. 
It also broke down at one point. 
The rooms are also very small. 
Overall, a good hotel and cheap.. 
Just obviously not premium.This was the best Inn I've ever been too.The Bed Bugs were monsters,and 5here cousins the cock a roach were hanging out too.very dirty and just not a safe place to be especially with kids,bare wires everywhere  and huge garbage can in hallway very noisy.
,The mattress was very comfortable though and the people that worked there were very friendly other than that two thumbs down..sorry RRI that renovation your doing is far overdue, but because of the staff and look Arion knowing it's doing a 2nd floor renovation on the red roof inn here in Vernon,CT.This Inn is very clean prior to any work but needs sinks and carpets  pulled  and new floors  installed.  
Make red roof inn great again !!! 
being renovated,6 month project ,I'd check it out again when I come to the windy city.Im from CT and actuaThe hotel staff was very nice and helpful. 
Great location for tourists wanting to see all Chicago has to offer. 
The rooms on the other hand were found wanting, definitely could be updated with fresher bathrooms and a whole new look in the room decor. 
But if you're looking for a place to crash for a night this will do just fine. 
We expected a good night's sleep with few amenities and that's exactly what we had. 
The well water had been softened a lot but still smelled slightly of sulfur. 
That was the only thing that kept them from being a 5-star version of a rural hotel with no amenities. 
The sink, located in the room not in the bathroom, would create an odor just by running the water.The desk clerk was very friendly. 
The first room we had, had no remote for the TV. 
That room also had spiders in the tub. 
The room we were switched to was much better.This place has mold, bugs, no pool. 
The air conditioning doesn't work. 
Rust on the doors bathrooms etc. 
Place needs to be shut down the worst nightmare I walked in too and straight out of we did not stay here would not stay for millions. 
I was afraid to bring anything in bc of what would have came back to my home. 
Broken windows,garbage cans, weeds everywhere.No actual quilt/cover on the beds. 
Just a sheet and a thin throw blanket.Water is gross af.. almost puked when I got in the shower.  
Went to other teammates room and had the same issue.  
I wish we weren't staying here, not impressed.  
Everything was great, from the staff at the counter to the refreshing lemongrass smell when we walked it the room. 
The room was clean and cozy and everything seemed updated. 
We couldn�t have asked for better. 
First time at this location and we would definitely go back!
Our stay was well-worth the price we paid. 
Room was comfortably large enough for two, bed was comfortable, amenities were sparse but unnecessary for a simple overnight stay anyway. 
Cleanliness of the room was good, with a few minor exceptions that are the only reason a star was docked. 
Staff at check-in were pleasant and efficient, and for a simple economy room, we were definitely satisfied.This place is NOT WORTH ONE STAR!!!  
It touts "newly remodeled" and we were not sure what had been remodeled.  
The room smelled musty; the bathroom had a portion of the wall which appeared to have been eaten away by mildew/mold.  
The grout in the shower tile was also dirty. 
There were no room amenities like a blow dryer, coffee maker. 
Heck, there were barely towels enough for two.  
We checked in, stayed about an hour in the room, went to dinner and LEFT. 
While it was budget-friendly, it was SO NOT WORTH IT!!  
The manager sent a personal email of apology for us not being satisfied, yet did NOT try to rectify our unhappiness by refunding our money.  
WHAT A WASTE!!  
TRAVELER...BEWARE!!!!!
I have to say that I'm very impressed with the renovations. 
They exceeded my expectations. 
I generally stay in 3* + but hotels were sold out this particular weekend. 
The first room smelled of cigarettes so we asked to switch and the manager happily obliged and even brought us the keys. 
Unfortunately the second room did as well, so we just dealt with it, BUT she brought us air freshener which was nice. 
It's a motel, you can't be too upset. 
Rooms were clean, no sign of bugs or anything in either room. 
I guess housekeeping didn't come because we were staying 2 nights, but when I called, the front desk staff said they were gone for the day, but came and made our beds for us and brought linens and tissue (how cute). 
Staff was amazing and friendly. 
Beds not the comfiest, but for $69, be grateful. 
Would stay here again if necessary.I mean you get what you pay for right? 
Well in this case, yes, but it wasn't a horrible stay. 
It was what I expected for the very affordable price. 
My child's father, my daughter and I stayed there for one night as we visited his sister for her graduation. 
My only expectations were for the room to be clean, no loud neighbors and the convenience of being in an area where I could grab a gift and a bite to eat. 
So all and all it was a nice peaceful stay. 
Nothing fancy but exactly what I expected and the plus was the staff was nice!
Very nice hotel. 
Superb staff. 
Great amenities. 
Convenient location. 
Awesome bar (Raised). 
Nice concierge lounge. 
Will definitely return.I stayed once before and I didn't have a great experience. 
However; I decided to stay again and was wowed by the service and staff. 
I was given an upgrade. 
First time ever as a Marriott Gold! 
Quite a room! 
Love the location because you can be in the Loop and navigate the rest of the city well. 
I got room service and food at the bar as well as the Lounge. 
The front desk was great and almost everyone emphasized their focus on service and guest well being.I spent an afternoon noon at the Renaissance Hotel for a professional conference on the the 3rd floor. 
This was a lunch with coffee and dessert. 
The presentation of the food was great , Nice and classy. 
They had wait staff that was very attentive and courteous. 
I was able to sit through the conference without being uncomfortable or too tired. 
Overall the hotel feels updated , but the ambiance is a little dark and "clubby" which is not my style. 
The lobby is open and spacious, a little rough to know where to go as the front desk is tucked around a wall.I had drinks outside at raised and really enjoyed it. 
The music inside was right up my alley and outside was nice because there were heat lamps everywhere. 
Good location and view.The hotel is nice, the staff are super friendly and helpful. 
There is a limited dine in menu, but the Mushroom Bisque was divine. 
I only wish better soundproofing had been used when making the rooms. 
I'm up at 3am because of city sounds & my meeting doesn't start til 8. 
It's going to be a long day.Location: right on the Magnificent Mile. 
It's at one far end of the mile so it's a bit of a jog to get around. 
Room: great overall. 
Clean, with a really nice kitchen. 
Service: amazing! 
Great staff and the very best breakfast buffet I've ever had!
The friendliest staff, and very clean hotel. 
I have stayed with this hotel 15 times in the last 12 months for a total of over 25 nights, and have enjoyed every single night. 
My son looks forward to seeing the familiar faces as well. 
I would recommend this hotel to anybody.Nice location but very few outlets worked in our bedroom and breakfast was a disaster.  
A sold out  hotel and they only have 1 person cooking and 2 people trying to clear tables and stock good.  
There was no eggs, bacon, waffle mix, water,  bread/pastries, forks, etc.  
The breakfast area was full and 20 people waiting 20-25 minutes for food to be restocked.  
I would not stay here again.  
The front desk was very nice and helpful when we checked in but when I sent them a. 
Chat about breakfast, no response, and then when I told them the issues in our room and breakfast when we checked out, there was zero interest.  
Pretty sad.Clean, spacious rooms. 
Very accommodating to all of our requests. 
Easy to get to with convienant valet parking (we have a toddler and a lot of luggage). 
Overall, a great stay so far.Fantastic Service, clean and very spacious rooms, fairly quiet area. 
Good deal using Priceline. 
A few blocks walk from the north part of the "Magnificent Mile" which was very nice. 
Definitely would stay here again.Very nice hotel. 
Room was comfortable, clean and a great place to relax after walking and visiting the sites of Chicago. 
Nicely located with great places around. 
The breakfast was pretty decent. 
The lady who helps there was very nice. 
She made breakfast extra pleasant.This was the forth time I have stayed here. 
This is another great part of the Marriott collection. 
The staff was supportive and provided me with every level of comfort. 
Centrally located and easy to get around. 
I will always recommend this location to family and friends.The hotel is nice enough. 
Pricey....way pricey, but probably because of the MLB playoffs...no problems with the room. 
There is a workout room and a pool/hot tub. 
Breakfast is pretty standard and does  not vary from day to day. 
The staff is nice. 
All in all though, a pleasant experience.Good City Hotel when you want some extra room.  
Entrance is on the 4th floor.  
Remodeled lobby and breakfast area.  
A couple of blocks away from Michigan, a little more quiet. 
Breakfast included. 
Parking is $65 per day.Lots of great restaurants within walking distance.The rooms are clean, warm, and well equipped for a stay. 
The staff is friendly and helpful. 
They go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. 
Veronica makes great coffee!
There was great service but almost all of the furniture was ripped or stainedSorry no review to give. 
I was delivering freight. 
The clerks were nice and very helpful on keeping me and customers safe.Clean spacious rooms, nice friendly staff, good breakfast, overall a good place to stayRoom was cleaned, organized, smell good, and plenty of towels. 
Staff were friendly and helpful.Freindly staff, clean rooms, great location next to the interstate.This hotel is awesome! 
Clean, spacious rooms and amazingly friendly staff! 
I have stayed at this Residence Inn a few times recently and they really do have amazing people that go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. 
I was a bit late for the dinner they offer, but when I walked through the door, they offered me dinner and a drink, which is just what I needed after a day at work! 
I would highly recommend this hotel!
Very nice place with all of the amenities and space that a business traveler needs. 
My room is huge, two rooms with a well equipped kitchen, full size refrigerator and an air conditioner that really does the job - I like my rooms cold. 
There's a pool, hot tub, nice exercise room, a full hot breakfast and a meal/sizeable snack most evenings. 
I'm very pleased with this place.I was there in July for a week and returned August 15 because John was very pleasant. 
John was forced to quit. 
I travel 30 days at a time and extend up to 90 days. 
This time I noticed many things wrong. 
A lady got bed bugs in room 320. 
When she told the GM (Matthew Baron) he did not follow through. 
I read a review that it happened to a lady two months ago. 
This means the problem is not solved. 
The dinners are limited. 
On hamburger night they ran out of lettuce and tomatoes by 6:30 when dinner goes until 7:30. 
Fruit is not available for breakfast on the weekends and they run out early during the week. 
The pool is cold. 
More cold than other hotels. 
The spa broke over a week ago and it is still not fixed. 
A  group of  teenagers showed up with speakers and played music. 
When I told the front desk I was told they go there yearly. 
Mom just stood there. 
I pay them $99 for 30 days. 
This is a steady income for them. 
Cutting corners, staff hours and not fixing items generates a bonus. 
I feel the GM is after a bonus. 
When I mentioned why I was leaving no one could blame me. 
A sign that there is some truth to my guess. 
I stayed long enough.   
:(Not for families! 
Business ppl yes wonderful hotel ppl were great... except Sarah she is an awful person rude to my kids! 
At 7 pm we were told to quiet down or leave. 
Customer service isn't for her... maybe the laundry room where she doesn't deal w people is a suitable place for her!
It is just a few turns off the exit. 
Friendly staff that was able to accommodate with efficiency a minor mix up about the number of beds we expected. 
Breakfast was fresh and well stocked. 
Breakfast included eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, bagels, juice, milk, and coffee. 
The rooms are spacious with a kitchen area that includes a coffee pot, dishwasher, stove, and refrigerator. 
They have a pool, workout room, and an outdoor fire pit. 
Overall a nice value for the money.Lovely charming home.  
Well kept!  
Really enjoyed the room and service.  
Juanita is a very funny and lovely host.  
She took care of our every need.  
Would recommend to anyone looking to get away for the the hustle of everyday life.Loved it. 
So many improvements made. 
Monica, Alaska and Jessica are the best to work with. 
Housekeeping also very friendly.Asked for a non smoking room. 
I was met at the door by a harsh old smoking smell. 
Called office and was told there were no other rooms available, but that they would bring the ozone machine to clean the smell out. 
I was told I would need to leave for about an hour while the machine ran. 
I took my toddler and left for a few hours. 
Upon return the room smelled exactly the same. 
Both lamps in the room had no light bulbs and the glass light covering that should've been attached to the light fixture in the  bathroom was left on the table. 
I called three times about the lamps and was told someone would come fix them, which never happened. 
The phone in the room also did not work. 
After coming to work at the hospital I noticed a bad stale cigarette smoke smell coming from my work scrubs! 
My hospital has a non smoking policy and I work in critical areas. 
Embarrassing, especially when I don't smoke! 
I removed my scrub jacket and hand washed it at work. 
I called the office at Rodeway and explained that this issue could cause an issue even at work. 
This is going on 4 days now. 
They stated a non smoking room would be available that day. 
Once I finally got into the new room, I felt some relief until that night laying in bed when a man used his key to get in our room!! 
Thank God I was under the sheets and had the top lock on!! 
I called and the night receptionist couldn't grasp what had happened and said she would reset my door. 
Great! 
I left the room the following morning only to return and find myself locked out too! 
I'm assuming the manager forgot she moved us to a new room and booked it with that guy, gave him a key and a viewing of me and my son in bed!
What an experience!! 
I will say the rooms were clean and the staff was nice. 
Other than that...I'm sure you can judge for yourselves. 
No one  has offered anything complimentary to make the experience any better either. 
Nothing other than a pitiful apology. 
Good luck!
Place is older and doesn't look like much on the outside, but rooms were nice and clean. 
Staff were very friendly. 
I would definitely stay again. 
Great prices thank uIt's a nice place to stay. 
Not too pricy. 
It's clean and good a/c. 
It's got the basics and the people here are niceExcellent reception desk.  
Very friendly people.  
Jessica Brown is a real professional.Haven't seen any bugs yet.  
Nice place for the rate.  
Apparently there is a drug problem,  I Was harassed by police with no name on badge in unmarked car,  for no reason.Disgustingly messed up drug/bug infested. 
Stayed here while waiting for my house to be ready worst mistake of my life. 
Kmeg and DCFS need to kick doors down. 
The office doesn't give a damn what goes on rooms are horrible of your not hearing people fighting you here them having sex weirdos hanging out outside banging on your door all night long. 
Lord don't smoke cigarettes they will come at you like roaches for one.... 
This place needs to be shut down how can this place remain open... 
BBB needs to do something asapBasic hotel bed and tv. 
Obviously not expensive but clean and securevery dirty.Pretty disgusting actually. 
The price was quite cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for...By being The owner and operator from renting i see there's nothing wrong with place FOR rent just need a future touch-up.This hotel is top notch. 
It is huge enough for very large conventions. 
They have the huge ballrooms as well as smaller conference rooms. 
The room I had was spacious and comfortable. 
I wish I had that bed at home. 
The rooms don't have mini fridges in them when you check in but you can ask and one will be brought to you. 
Maid service was slow but very good. 
The bar and restaurants are terribly expensive but you already knew that.Beautiful intercity hotel. 
Clean comfortable rooms. 
Expected price for food, because  you are in a prime location.  
Exercise  facilities  are excellent.  
The pool is actually  a 45 foot lap pool!  
Would stay  there again.Great place. 
Coffee downstairs advertises Starbucks.  
Only carry's Pike. 
Save yourself some money and go to a real Starbucks on Michigan St. instead. .... 
Coffee here is $3.70 for a small...The room was spectacular.  
The beds are wonderful and the pillows inviting. 
The shower is amazing: instant hot water and the water jets will blast you through the wall. 
Lovely!
My experience sadly was only with the customer service and accounting departments. 
I made a reservation for a business conference in 2018. 
I unfortunately had to cancel my reservation and called the hotel 2 days after making my reservation. 
Almost 2 weeks later I hadn't received my deposit back. 
I called and was told that the money was never taken out of my account. 
I called my bank and they assured me it was. 
I can understand a mistake, an oversight but my repeated attempts to connect with accounting was ignored. 
I left 2 voicemails to which the recording assured me I would be contacted within 24 hours. 
I NEVER WAS! 
I emailed and no response. 
I called the front desk and the attendant was rude and unapologetic. 
The Manger on Duty was polite, apologetic and took my name and number to which no one contacted me. 
FINALLY, I tried to call one more time and was contacted to a real person in accounting. 
She was rude, unapologetic about the refund or the lack in returning my messages and email.  
I emailed the GM and I have not nor do I expect a response due to my experience with customer service at the Sheraton thus far. 
I will never stay at any of the Sheraton chain hotels.Great location.  
Very nice view from room.  
Comfortable bed.  
Friendly and helpful staff.  
The rooms are a bit dated, but clean.The rooms are nice and full of accommodations. 
We're talking a fridge, a safe, the simplest a/c. 
Things have been real quiet especially considering that it's so close to the El railway. 
People are cool behind the desk. 
I saw someone withhold a star because the people at the check in desk didn't wave to them everytime they came and went. 
I get it, but the desk isn't that close to the elevator that it required that level of acknowledgement so frequently. 
The location is good. 
Its safe and has so many places to eat. 
It's also a small block or two away from the best and cheapest parking in the area. 
It's also close to many hotels like the wit, and some other places.Fantastic hotel. 
I am used to the bigger chains but this one is far better. 
AWESOME room and nice staff. 
Great experience and nice decor. 
Clean too.Spent five nights here while attending a conference. 
The property was very nice, with a modern, but slightly art deco vibe. 
Staff was friendly and helpful. 
AC and plumbing were new and worked great. 
There are no views from room windows.  
EL train runs above Wabash Street in front of the hotel, but once inside the hotel you would not know it. 
This is Chicago.!! 
Good food just down the street in either direction.This hotel is quite nice with a lot of space and two televisions. 
Great service at the front desk. 
I stayed here with my wife who had it for work.  
I think they cater to corporate clients and search. 
Very nice bar but nobody there usually.Had a very nice stay this week. 
Big comfortable.room. 
Great location. 
Upscale without being too pretentious. 
Would give it 5 stars but one of the front desk women we had to deal with a couple of times was unneceasaruly short when we checked in and seemed unhappy every time we walked by her and said hello. 
The rest of the staff were friendly and attentive. 
Had to travel to Iowa for business, wound up getting a room at the Sleep Inn in North Liberty.  
It looks like it was built not too long ago, has a pool and the rooms are in good condition.  
All of the toiletries were sandalwood-scented (soap, shampoo, conditioner and hand lotion).  
Not a deal-breaker at all, just unusual.  
If I'm ever back in the area and need a decent room at a decent price, I'll will go here.  
Breakfast was an 8/10 (on a free hotel breakfast scale).Very nice and new, good price, under $100 a night. 
Kind of in the middle of nowhere but only 15 minutes to shopping and university of Iowa. 
Small pool and nowhere outside to hang out. 
Breakfast was kind of small as well. 
Rooms were very large, easily sleep 6 with pullout couch. 
Would definitely stay again for the price.Overall, we had a pleasant stay here. 
The breakfast is consistent - every time - we've stayed here. 
The gal kept the breakfast filled for the guest.  
We had a hot tub suite and it was great!  
Hot tub was decently sized and my girlfriend and I were able to be in there with comfort.  
Along with a decent/clean room, the A/C worked nicely too :)  The only downside was the bed was hard so for those that don't like firm beds, you may want to look elsewhere for a good nights sleep.Very nice hotel extremely clean and well-kept outside and in. 
I would sleep here above the Quality Inn even though it's the same chain. 
The breakfast was good and friendly staff very quiet rooms. 
Would definitely come backIt was clean and the bed was comfortable.  
There is a pool which is fun.  
And a hit breakfast was provided in the morning.  
The hotel didn't have extra pillows available.This place is disgusting!!! 
One look at the bathroom and I wanted my money back right away. 
I would have rather went and paid the extra $10 -$20 somewhere else. 
Don't know if they give refunds but I will post once I find out. 
A Pilot or Loves would be a better place for a shower. 
The hall smelled of urine and loud (weed/marijuana), it was dirty like they have no cleaning service or people don't know how to use garbage cans to throw trash away. 
When we got to the room there was nothing in it remotely comfortable. 
We don't even trust the bed and I have the strongest feeling we'll hear mice tonight if we stay. 
No microwave, coffee pot, or mini fridge. 
Everything is outdated and barely working, like the light in the room didn't even have a lamp shade. 
This place is pathetic! 
Highly disappointed. 
My husband checked the receipt and there are no refunds. 
I wouldn't have even have given this place a half of a star let alone one. 
I hope this prevents anyone from making the mistake we did. 
Hopefully the Motel 6 across the street is better than this place for tomorrow and I'm so grateful I told him one night. 
The manager had the nerve to get mad at the maid for lack of cleanliness when it was beyond her reach. 
Not only that he looked at my husband and I like we were crazy because we found the place despicable compared to the other guests who obviously didn't know any better or were just grateful not to be homeless. 
The laundry room has several signs saying use at your own risk and after using it I could see why. 
Our clothes came out dirtier than they were before. 
This place is a disaster and I would recommend a some work or tear it down and start from scratch.Me and my husband had the worst experience at this horrible place. 
We arrived on a Friday evening to only one set of towels and never received towels for our our whole stay which was Friday to Sunday. 
They continuously gave us a run around about the towels then got rude when we asked for the only two face towels she could find on Sunday being our last day and when I asked for the owner he was not there of course. 
We also had no remote to the tv and paid extra for a microwave that was in the lobby not our room. 
Just a horrible experience!
The first room they gave me was not even cleaned. 
The bed was not made and there was garbage on the floor. 
The second wasn't much better but at least someone made the bed and change the sheets. 
Absolutely disgusting.The room was dirty and stunk of cigarettes I will never stay there again the staff was not. 
PleasantThis place is gross! 
Lamp and other electric fixtures are broken, couch smells like urine, found clothes, found cocaine in the carpet, television is poor quality, no bible in desk (hotel rule), mold in refrigerator, etc. 
Three fourths of the patrons were smoking  leaving an impression of nasty  (Non smoking municipality.). 
Bartender greeted me with her cigarette in hand, and did not know the types of beer on draft. 
My clothes reeked after a single beer And I couldn't get out of there fast enough. 
Felt I was imposing & intruding rather than enjoying a new place. 
There are several cleaner friendlier places a few seconds down the road. 
Nice place nice people Cozy local bar.  
Friendly bartenders and customers.  
Great drink specials,  good music,  and a couple of pool tables if you like to shoot. 
Best bar in townThey still allow smoking in the bar.A very nice RV park. 
It has its own fishing pond. 
There is also creek that goes along the west side and north side of the park. 
Park office gate security at the entrance. 
Some people have park model units there year round,other bring their campers when they come down. 
It's been kind of a hidden jewel in the area. 
Can't see it from the main hwy.Really like this place!
Total relaxation and seclusion Love the peacefulness I feel from being there.Relaxing with friends Awesome hotel! 
Extremely hospitable staff. 
If you can, stay on one of the higher floors for a nice view. 
Spacious rooms with nice amenities. 
We visit the city fairly often so this will definitely become one of our staple stays. 
And there's free breakfast!!
This hotel is great! 
My spouse stays here often for work. 
The rooms are clean and the beds comfy. 
The staff at breakfast make the whole stay worth it, they're so friendly! 
It's nice and centrally located in Chicago, close to lots of things. 
My only complaint is the amount of chlorine in the pool/whirlpool, but that seems pretty standard.We were in Chicago for a wedding and SpringHills Suites was a great place to stay. 
The facilities were nice, the location is central, and the staff was very nice and accommodating. 
They helped us out so we can be on the same floor as the rest of our family, and even provided items we forgot to pack like a toothbrush and razor. 
The breakfast was good but what made our stay great was the friendly service. 
I would definitely recommend the SpringHill Suites if you're in Chicago.This was a wonderful location for our family weekend in Chicago.  
Near all of the downtown attractions, and the breakfast was wonderful.  
Only 2 things prevented me from giving 5 stars...they do not have ice makers on the floors, so you have to go to the lobby for ice or call the front desk...and there were no rooms available when we wanted to go back in October.Stayed for 3 nights visiting Chicago for the first time. 
Great location. 
Walking distance to so many attraction. 
Rooms are very comfortable. 
Breakfast had a great variety and staff was very friendly and helpfulMy husband and I come here every summer. 
Everyone is super friendly! 
I wish we could visit more often. 
It's the best resort I've ever been to and they've got all kinds of cool things on there so I would highly recommend coming on down and seeing Sun auraChecked it out for a visit next year & was given a tour.  
Looks like a fun place to visit.  
Staff & campers were very friendly. 
This is a great place for clothing optional. 
Owners as great,  everyone is friendly,  great pool, can't find anything bad too day about the place.  
Beware though, once you go there you will love the place and want to be there all the time. 
They have dances every weekend and other activities throughout the year. 
See you there.How could you not love this place? 
Just left there for the first time, and let me just say I'LL BE BACK! 
Everyone should try this out. 
A big thank you to the staff. 
Won't fix or clean anyone's housesGreat if you dont like running water.......Don't know personally about the motel itself, so I won't say much, but just thought I'd mention there's no elevator. 
Had family members visiting the area (one of which is in a wheelchair) and reserved a room on the second floor expecting there to be an elevator. 
Unfortunately there was no way to get the wheelchair up the stairs. 
Had to find a room at a different hotel as the main floor was full. 
The staff was great and didn't charge for the room and were helpful, but anyone needing a walker or wheelchair needs to realize they HAVE to get a room on the main floor. 
Hope this helps someone in their planning!
was Great especially�at for the price all the staff was great helpful kind and polite it was clean neat no bugs cleaning ladies always asked if I need anything when I was coming and going one of the ladies behind the desk event looked up a number for me the pool was nice clean and they gave me a refund when I left a day early I just wish that Super 8 corporation would add a sausage or something to there continental breakfast i am going to leave reviews on a few sites because it was that good and most of the time people only leave reviews to complainIt's a place to stay and sleep. 
I wouldn't call it nice, exactly. 
Local weirdos staying here. 
Cops banging on door woke me up due to halucinating dope head claiming gangs were after him banging on doors. 
Woman raising hell in lobby over lost cigarettes.. 
It's also kinda dirty. 
But, it's better than other offerings nearby. 
Staff are nice folks.Pretty much a place to sleep room was clean bed comfy. 
Breakfast non existent. 
Does have pool didn't use it. 
But have one.It was very close to alot of stores. 
And very easy to get to.i enjoyed my stay very muchwe arrived in the twilight of the evening. 
The place looks good both inside and outside. 
Only met one staff member, who was very pleasant, and quickly got us our room. 
Very clean room, including the shower area. 
Breakfast was good. 
Would stay again if in the area.Very nice rooms at a reasonable rate. 
Excellent location near food and fuel. 
Good air conditioning. 
My only complaint is the small bathroom.Reserved room through Wyndham rewards. 
Check in was quick and easy. 
The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, pleasant, and helpful. 
The room was clean, nicely decorated, and spacious enough for a king bed with micro and fridge. 
Bathroom was clean and spacious enough. 
Wifi worked well. 
Entry to our room could be obtained from the parking lot and an inner hall depending on what door we chose to use. 
Very satisfied. 
Would stay again.Not a place to get a good night's sleep.  
Trains run nearby throughout the night and will wake you up at all hours.  
On the positive side, there is a Waffle House nearby if you need coffee or a meal.Great place! 
Clean friendly quiet. 
What more do you want?
Nice hotel there almost through remodeling the place, the staff is friendly well at least the individuals I have talked to Nikki, and Rebecca and they will greet  you when your coming or going which is nice. 
It�s hard enough working out of town away from your family so its nice to get a friendly smile so if you need a comfortable place to sleep I suggest you stay at the Super 8. 
The only reason I didn�t give them 5 stars is there is no washer n dryer.Wifi cuts out every 5 minutes. 
Rooms are ok at best. 
Bring your own hot spot if you can cuz you cannot get internet here.Needs work.  
The air conditioner in our.room did not work.  
But was a clean room with nice bathroom.  
The staff is really nice. 
It was a quiet stay. 
The room was clean for the most part with the exception of spider webs in multiple corners in the room completely visible and easy to access. 
The motel is under renovation at this time so there is less room for them to accomodate the guests with breakfast and no microwave as they claim they dont have the room. 
The grounds have a lot of garbage around it and junky furniture for outdoor seating. 
Looks rundown outside to be honest but the reason for me staying here is that they allow dogs. 
I would not have stayed here otherwise.Its a motel. 
It served its purpose and there is a Denny's close by. 
Easy access to the Highway and everything is on par for the price. 
Good stay!
First, the floor. 
If you stood in one spot too long, you started to sink in and had to extract your foot when you moved. 
It was like a sticky movie theater floor, but it was carpet. 
The bathroom was dirty, and the toilet seat looked like it had been "cleaned" with dry toilet paper. 
We used Lysol wipes on every surface and still didn't feel like it was clean. 
Our experience only got worse from there. 
There was someone playing loud bass music all night somewhere in the motel.  
Although the desk clerk tried to find where it was coming from, he was unable to do so. 
We asked to be moved to a quieter room, but he claimed that all the other rooms were either occupied or reserved, and he politely informed us that we couldn't get a refund when we asked. 
It was a miserable night, and although the noise wasn't necessarily their fault, at the very least, they could have made sure that the room was clean. 
Never again.The hotel was about what I would expect from a Super 8. 
Room was clean. 
Hotel was older and a bit run down. 
Every time my husband moved in bed it felt like an earthquake. 
We only had two towels even though we registered four people and the towels were really skimpy. 
I did like the white noise from the air conditioning unit, it was nice and consistent and helped to cut out the normal hotel noises. 
Location was convenient to shopping and dining and close to the sports complex, so I would probably stay again for an overnight.We were here for a school function for one night. 
It started with all of the rooms smelling like smoke or mold. 
Everyone's room that we went into had smelled the same way, so it had not been just our room. 
The microwave didn't work, and bathroom cleanness was horrible. 
Defiantly didn't appreciate the hair and urine found throughout the bathroom. 
Ceiling seemed to be splattered with some kind of residue. 
Lets just say we stayed up super late to avoid the bed as much as possible.Had a great stay, no issues, the attendant Andy was of great help with booking a second room. 
I would stay againI was treated like I was in prison. 
They were racist and condecending. 
I wouldn't tell anyone to stay there! 
There are roaches and flying bugs in the dark rooms?. 
The staff doesn't speak English and rudely speak in their language. 
I guess no one told them it was rude. 
They wake you up when they want to Early in the a.m. by beating keys on the door jamb loudly. 
The only reason I stayed two weeks was because I had a ton of belongings. 
Worst hotel I've ever been in.If all you need is a place to sleep for a couple  of days this is the place. 
Clean and reasonably  priced, don't expect much else. 
Plenty of dining options within walking distance both local and chain places.Clean hotel. 
Good overnight stay for the price. 
Not the best but far from the worst. 
You get a good room for price you pay. 
I would stay again.my husband and I, and our friends came for the concert of 7/7/2017, we couldn't find a taxi or cab service to come and pick us up so I went to the front desk hoping she would be able to assist us. 
She immediately was concerned about us getting to the concert on time and that we had everything we needed so we were comfortably getting there. 
She downloaded UBER on my phone for me and helped me get a ride set up for $45.00 cheaper than what the local taxi service was going to charge. 
She helped us put in my credit card information and everything to ensure we got a safe ride to the amphitheater. 
She took about 15 minutes of her own time to make sure we got the ride set up and then she also printed our 4 tickets from Groupon out. 
I tried offering her a hefty tip, but she refused to take it and commented that she is already getting paid to work and help the customers to her best capability. we seen her later that night and to be honest, without her help we would've never gotten to or from the concert. 
Amazing customer service skills, awesome Attitude and contagious smile. 
I wouldn't let her go anywhere if I were you!!! 
She made us always want to stay at the super 8 anytime we we in townVery nice,  comfy place.   
As far as I can tell very quiet.   
I found nothing wrong when I stayed.   
However some gusts would not agree.   
I guess everyone is entitled to their  own opinion.  
Even if I think they are wrong. 
Was attending a concert at the Hollywood Amphitheatre. 
Reserved a room online at Priceline. 
Staff was super friendly even to a person who showed up dressed for a metal show. 
Room was cute in an early 2000s trading spaces kind of way. 
Very clean and smelled like clean laundry, not unpleasant or strong, just like sheets without fabric softener fresh out of the dryer. 
The breakfast was a little thin... 
White bread and plain bagels, oatmeal, coffee, orange juice, and yoplait. 
It's cool if they don't do hot breakfast but I wasn't that enthused about the options. 
Amazing for the price, would definitely recommend or stay again.Currently here at the hotel now with my children. 
We've been here for some days. 
The staff is very personable and prompt. 
Great customer service goes a long way. 
I made reservations online so I was a bit skeptical, especially since I've never stayed at this hotel before. 
I got an early check in after calling to see if I can check in earlier than 3. 
The rooms are lovely and comfortable. 
The women who work here are adorable and pleasant. 
I have no complaints and will definitely be back. 
I wish that I could remember everyone's names but just know that everyone is great and even kid friendly. 
The cleaning staff had small talk with my children earlier while cleaning ?
My time at the super 8 was great. 
The employee Mary was very nice and really helpful. 
The room was nice and clean. 
As long as Mary is there I recommend anyone to stay there.Room was alot nicer than I thought it would be.  
Was pretty clean. 
Had a little different smell when walking in to the room. 
But not deadly!  
Bed was comfy. 
Here for only four hours to sleep but  I would definitely come back.I had a two queen bed room and one of the bedspreads was stained inside and out. 
The other  bedspread had a cigarette burn hole in it. 
The bathroom had not even been cleaned as someone had bad aim for the toilet and the tub was dirty. 
I did not use the shower and only went in the bathroom with shoes on. 
You could barely get the bathroom door open because the height of the carpet wedges the door on the carpet. 
The last issue was with the room door. 
You could push or pull the door open without turning the handle. 
You had to lift the door after you closed it in order for it to lock. 
Once closed and locked, you had to lift the door to unlock and open it. 
Sorry, although this place has been nicely updated, I won't be back.The staff is very friendly and personable.  
This a a great value and the room is kept tidy and clean.  
The shower is very powerful and high quality and the cleaning staff is available.  
I didn't have any concerns with the hotel and would highly recommend this hotel when travelling HWY 57 Chicago.It is clean but very outdated. 
There is no desk, but there is a table with 2 chairs that are very uncomfortable, especially if overweight.  
The lighting in the room is very bad. 
The mattress is comfortable,  but not the pillows! 
The water pressure is very low.4443. 
No elevator,  very few seats for breakfast.Reserved room through Wyndham rewards. 
Check in was quick and easy. 
The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, pleasant, and helpful. 
The room was clean, nicely decorated, and spacious enough for a king bed with micro and fridge. 
Bathroom was clean and spacious enough. 
Wifi worked well. 
Entry to our room could be obtained from the parking lot and an inner hall depending on what door we chose to use. 
Very satisfied. 
Would stay again.Overall: standard but very nice. 
Clean rooms with standard adornments (fridge, microwave, small coffee maker, tv). 
Slightly dated, but well maintained. 
Breakfast is limited, but long duration makes working with your schedule easy. 
Very comfortable beds. 
AC keeps rooms as hot or cold as you want.We had an awesome stay. 
Very clean and very friendly staff. 
This is a great place to stay and close to Peoria!!! 
One of the best breakfasts we have had in a long time! 
You wont be disappointed.Really, this hotel is all about the price. 
It is exactly what I expected for $78. 
The room appeared to be clean. 
Everything worked as or should. 
Decor was bland and outdated. 
Breakfast was free, but was also pretty sparse, eggos, hard boiled eggs, appkes, bananas, cereal, toast, bagels, and yogurt. 
It's a basic hotel, and a good value.I bring my children here usually twice a year as this is our Chicago home away from home. 
Great crew of people running the place.  
I have never had a bad experience with the staff or property.  
Great location for Chicago activities.  
Awesome rooms and suites with beautiful views. 
Swimming pool and hot tub is the best. 
Located 10 minutes from dozens of food and entertainment options.Traveled to this hotel twice in two years for a business meeting. 
Evening check-in staff was less than friendly/borderline rude both times. 
Rooms were comfortable but nothing spectacular for the price. 
It was clean and well kept. 
Leave the hotel to get dinner, there are much better dining options off-site. 
Room service breakfast was good.Great hotel! 
Beautiful lobby, good location. 
There were some minor things like a rip in one of the bed sheets and the coffee maker outlet not working (we moved it to a different outlet and all was well). 
Overall we had a great stay with a beautiful view of Chicago!
I participated in a jury study that was held in the Montreux rooms. 
Which had beautiful lighting from the floor to ceiling windows as well as the fixtures that hung from the ceiling. 
The food was amazing! 
French cuisine that was still approachable. 
Whitefish and Chicken Thighs. 
Roasted root vegetables and a delicious green salad with creamy French cheese can't remember which one. 
During one of the breaks we had giant Bavarian Pretzels were provided. 
All the servers were friendly and went above. 
One of the women had food allergies and they made a meal for her without any of her allergy triggers. 
Their valet service is pretty pricey $70 for the day. 
Take public transportation if you have an event here if they won't be providing reimbursement on parking back to save yourself $70 plus tip.We loved every aspect of this hotel. 
Easy check in and out. 
The bar had great drinks and all the staff was very polite. 
Our room was clean, quiet,  and well maintained. 
I would recommend this hotel for sure!
Amazing hospitality.. the room is just as you see it.. gorgeous. 
The gentleman up front at the desk was so helpful he even blew up my rubber ? 
inflatable with his helium tank because they did not have an air pump.. very great place for couples .. definitely going again!!
Great room, except one of the lights was stuck permanently on, making sleep rather difficult. 
The front desk was quite unhelpful and did not resolve the issue until the next day. 
They said the manager would be in contact, but as it turned out I had to contact them. 
Then they offered a partial minor refund, and then a free night, but have yet to follow up on their word even after I checked up a couple times. 
At this point, I would be reluctant to provide any recommendation on account of the exceptionally unprofessional service as indicated by other reviews as well. 
Great venue, clean, modern; but honestly pretty sub-par, lousy service for what you pay in comparison to anywhere else in that range. 
If you're ok with that, try them out, otherwise steer clear. 
I rely on reviews a lot, so I figured I would contribute.Stayed at the Sybaris Frankfort for 2 nights. 
The room was very clean, the staff was fabulous and the amenities were amazing. 
My only complaint would be that there's no housekeeping but it would have been difficult since we never left the room much so I understand why they don't provide it. 
They do however drop of fresh towels and toiletries at your request. 
Will definitely stay here again!
Our experience was amazing! 
When you walk in you're in paradise immediately. 
The room was very clean, Everything was fresh and the ladies in the office were extremely helpful as well. 
The pool and hot tub alone are worth it,then there's the massage chair,steam room and enough mirrors to ensure you don't miss a thing!! 
Will definitely return. 
My husband and I did not want to come home.We stayed in a poolside suite, (I think that's what it was called) it had a pool, hot tub, steam room, king size bed, fireplace, and more little surprises that we didn't expect! 
I was happy when we checked in, and even happier when we left! 
10/10, would definitely recommend this to a romance seeking couple.Love loving here.Hillbillies Kinda dumpyWe had a fantastic stay at The Alise. 
Came on a weeknight and paid less than $200 for the room and overnight valet parking, which isn't terrible considering the location. 
It was within walking distance to all the spots we needed. 
The staff was incredible and the room (although small) was comfortable. 
The individual duvets on the bed were a nice touch, it may be the best I've ever slept (and yes, we are now going to adapt the 2-duvets 1-bed style). 
My only complaint was the bathroom facilities could use some maintenance/updating. 
Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at The Alise immensely and will be staying there again.Really great place to stay in! 
Staff are super helpful and friendly. 
Its very central and near walking distance of a lot of shops and food places. 
Hotel offered infused water, muffins and coffee all day which made the stay more homely.The hotel was very nice! 
Fantastic views of the city, very clean rooms and a friendly staff. 
We did have issues with a package we ordered (my girlfriend paid to have beer on ice upon our arrival, and it was not there and we had to remind them several times to bring it up). 
However, they provided the package free of charge for the trouble. 
Very good service! 
I would recommend this hotel for anyway who wants to stay in the heart of Chicago.Great stay in clean and fashionable hotel.  
Very friendly and helpful staff.  
In particular, perfect location. 
Only improvement would be a more interesting restaurant/bar option.Great historic architecture and architectural accents, friendly and accommodating service, convenient location to downtown attractions. 
We really enjoyed our overnight. 
The rooms and common areas have held onto some interesting design elements of the building's past. 
Room was very clean. 
The bikes were a fun extra, I just wished that had an assortment of frame sizes. 
We will definitely be back.The rooms I've booked were clean on my visits, it's 4 blocks south of Sox pk green line is 2 blocks south of here. 
An ample parking lot a great soul food restaurant Pearls located on the premises a decent rib/burger joint across the street and a Rothchilds liquor store on the corner. 
There is a 20 dollar returnable fee for smoking on my last visit though. 
There are cheaper alternatives if one has flexibility.I loved my stay at the Amber Inn! 
It was closed in a court-yard like area that made me feel safe.Great rooms friendly people good ratesNice place would really like to come here when I have a little bit more money quiet and I have not seen very much happening in Chicago they say it's a bad place but it's notPrice is good because of the location to downtown; it should be the cheapest motel/hotels from downtown overpriced ones.It does not have all the amenities of a 5 star hotel, which you might never use, despite be charged, there are at least no bedbugs_ something I fear the most from cheap motels.It has free parking in the courtyard, close to Marianos, and Michigan ave buses. 
Overnight parking downtown $57.. 
It has security cameras too.So if you want to save money, I guess it's a good deal to stay here.Thanks for reading.Best stay I've had since the Ritz in Central Park.I think that it has one of the best locations in Chicago!  
It's 30 min walk to Michigan Ave and shopping.  
It's 20-25 min walk to the Museum of Science.  
It's a 20 min walk to the Theater where Hamilton is playing.  
And there are lots of 4-5 star restaurants nearby.The rooms have marble floors and plumbing with deep marble basins and very modern showers.  
The tub is not as deep as the Ritz's but it's still fine for soaking in.Make sure you get a lake view room.  
The hotel is across from Grant Park (where Obama gave his first acceptance speech as President), and you can see out into Lake Michigan and the Ferris Wheel at the pier.The lobby is gorgeous. 
This hotel may not be as tony as the Ritz but it's not too far off and it's half the price.I'm so happy with this stay. 
The room size, design, and bed quality are all great. 
Big windows and classy furniture and fixtures too. 
Great location, plenty within walking distance, and a part of Marriott rewards.Stayed for Valentines Day weekend. 
This hotel is just fantastic. 
Great location on Michigan Ave, staff are warm, friendly and incredibly helpful. 
Rooms and bathrooms are very large. 
Great views. 
Hotel in the restaurant has great food and a lovely staff. 
Beautiful lobby, ballroom, huge fitness center and an art gallery. 
They allow and are very accommodating of dogs.Only downfalls: Parking too pricey.The best thing about the Blackstone is the staff. 
They are friendly and extremely accommodating in every department. 
I arrived as an Irma refuge, after a week of no ac in my Florida home. 
The Blackstone staff enfolded me in gracious care, even though my appearance and dress were no doubt not the usual they serve every day. 
They get 5 stars plus. 
The hotel itself is fine for the older reno it is. 
The restaurant is superb. 
The fitness center is well-appointed and has a stunning view. 
The beds are decent although I'm not a fan of feather pillows. 
But the staff will fix any small defect. 
Well, almost...the room lighting is abysmal: badly placed, too dim. 
The sliding glass bathroom door not only offers no privacy but makes nighttime usage invasive to fellow roommates. 
And if you're unlucky enough to be a smoker, you're sent out on the street like trash. 
Oh, and the toilet paper does not say "luxury" but "bus station."
Renovated and now part of Marriott. 
On Michigan Ave. 
Outdoor dinning. 
Great tapas restaurant Mercat off nice lobby area with seating facing Michigan Ave from second level. 
Starbucks on lower level accessed by elevators and stairs. 
Classic old Chicago hotel back in action. 
Nice walk to Soldiers Field and museums.Very upscale. 
Gorgeous room's with huge windows. 
They got us a reception room for our family reunion to have pizza. 
The room was unreal wide open and very relaxing.The hotel was very hard to find and even when we did we couldn't tell until talking to front desk. 
Once we got to the room and understood the layout, everything was great! 
The room was clean and the view was phenomenal! 
The view is worth the stay and the club is just bonus. 
The mini bar was not over priced and the water pressure is good with warm water. 
Room is somewhat dated but bed is comfortable. 
We will definitely stay here again if we stay in Chicago!!
Everything was excellent. 
The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. 
The rooms clean and comfortable. 
Really my only complaint was that the remote didn't control the tv, only the cable box. 
We will definately stay here next time we are in Chicago.It was a little confusing at first to navigate your way around but once you've done it twice it becomes easy. 
Rooms are spacious and clean nice view of the city. 
Staff was friendly and courteous.I stayed here for 4 nights and would absolutely recommend it. 
The rooms are on the 40th floor and I believe all the rooms have amazing views as mine sure did. 
The location was perfect for getting to all the major tourist attractions. 
Subway station is literally around the corner. 
Bed was comfy and apparently they have an awesome gym available for guests.I recently visited the Drake Hotel for a professional networking event, and from the moment I walked in, I knew that they had selected the perfect place. 
As soon as I approached the doors I was welcomed by the people at the front, and they guided me to the direction of the event. 
Upon entering the room, I noticed the immense detail and quality of the hotel. 
The cleanliness was incredible, the carpet was soft and comfortable, and the chairs and upholstery matched very well. 
At the same time, the air was cool and relaxing. 
At the event, the hosts were very friendly and willing to go out of their way to make us feel welcome.Very nice and fancy hotel. 
Lots of crown molding and carpeted floors. 
Flowers in vases in the lobby with plenty of bellhops and front desk assistance. 
Rooms were elegant and very nice. 
A great hotel with the feeling of the 60s or 70s. 
Not a modern hotel but very nice.We stayed at the Drake for three days in Sep 2017. 
The room is big, clean and cozy. 
The decoration is really classic. 
The bathroom is clean. 
The bed is really soft and comfortable. 
The house keeping service and persons were nice and welcoming. 
We enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea at the palm court. 
Except that I hope there is more room in the fridge within the room for the customers to store food and having microwave in the room, the overall experience is excellent.We had a WONDERFUL and relaxing time at The Drake. 
Had a perfect martini in the Palm Court and a made to order breakfast in Camellia's. 
On top of that we had an exquisite view of the lake. 
We'll be back.I visited the Drake for a friend's wedding. 
The interior of the hotel is gorgeous, and its ballrooms are stunning! 
A perfect venue for a grand wedding. 
It also has the most adorable gift shop with unique seasonal decorations. 
Highly recommend this place for locals and for visitors. 
This hotel reminds me of some Victorian style  hotels in the UK. 
It's absolutely good, but sometimes you mention some odd things like a crack in a mirror, door knobs needing a special treatment and so on. 
However it's charming and never disturbing your stay. 
The staff is professional and very friendly. 
The rooms are clean and comfortable. 
Evanston is a very nice town north of Chicago. 
In a 10 minute walk you can take the train to downtown Chicago. 
And within another 10 minute walk  you really can enjoy the beaches of the Great Lakes. 
This is a charming historic hotel.  
It is not a chain hotel, so those who prefer chains may be surprised by this place.  
First--you cannot park there.  
If you bring a car, you can park for $7 a day in the city garage around the corner.  
Par for the course in a city, but if you're used to suburban hotels that could be a surprise.  
Also, the rooms are smallish and older (though well-maintained, of course), and when you want two beds, you get two twins. 
Also, be prepared to not have a coffee maker in the room.  
We were here last weekend for a girls' trip, and absolutely loved it.  
We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.  
The location is perfect (a quick walk to the shore, near an L station, but far enough from the hustle for quiet); the staff was very friendly; they have a nice breakfast (and it was lovely to sit outside and watch the locals while we ate); and we thought the room was adorable.Nice staff, great restaurant in the hotel, cool aesthetic. 
The building keeps its historical charm. 
However this means the rooms are small and a double bed is two small twin beds. 
Otherwise the place is great!
First of all, I visited for a four day conference and one word: Location location location! 
Wonderful place. 
Very walk friendly to subway, train, and bus stations, Whole Foods, lake and parks and beautiful vegetation everywhere! 
The showers were extremely tight on the inside (I stayed on 2nd floor) but other than that everything was absolutely phenomenal. 
Very sweet and friendly staff, people everywhere, dog friendly, clean, and the biggest plus was that free continental breakfast in the am! 
Yes indeed. 
Old school feel with great customer service and management. 
Super close to downtown and lakefront. 
Very nice patio. 
Quality restaurant. 
Parking can be difficult at times but Church Street Garage is close. 
Definitely recommend. 
I booked here somewhat hesitantly after seeing a few pictures online that made the guest rooms appear small, but it was outweighed by the excellent location. 
Boy was I pleasantly surprised when we checked into our spacious, stylish and incredibly comfortable queen room. 
Not only was the room well-appointed, but the staff was professional, courteous, and went the extra mile in suggesting alternative rooftop terraces when they told us their terrace wad closed for the season. 
Best of all, I had one of the best nights of sleep I can remember and I am notoriously picky about mattresses. 
There's no doubt we'll be back on our next visit! 
Location, price, amenities, all exceeded expectations.Fantastic service! 
Rooms are sizable and ample, and the showers are pretty great. 
The daily cookie delivery is a nice, sweet touch. 
The staff was all very helpful and great to speak with and overall had no issues during my stay. 
Only downside was that the rooftop bar closed early on a Sunday, wish it was open longer!
A very beautiful hotel with an excellent location in the heart of Streetorville. 
The rooms are beautiful and well appointed with exception of the damn ice bucket. 
The rooftop bar is very nice, beautiful view and a good pour for the money. 
Park your car yourself using spot hero as parking is about $60 if you do it through the hotel.There�s no pool or exercise facilities, but planet fitness is around the corner and they do give you a voucher for a yoga class if you�re into that thing.Attended a wedding here. 
Arrived a bit early, so went to the rooftop terrace. 
Drink prices were reasonable for downtown Chicago. 
Ballroom was nice for an intimate wedding, but food service was a bit slow during the reception.Couldnt be happier with my experience. 
They were so polite and accommodating. 
The suite was gorgeous, jacuzzi spacious! 
It was a five star experience, top notch. 
I wouldnt stay anywhere else now.Stayed here towards the end of August and had them store my luggage including a little bag that had a bottle of unopened wine in that I put in it right before handing my bags to them.When I picked up my bags an employee goes look like your bag is leaking and I'm not sure why.I open up my little bag and the whole bottom of the bottle is broken off in half. 
All of my bags contents including an iPad and notebooks for a convention happening the next day is soaked. 
Inside of my suitcase many of my clothes were soaked as this bag was put on top of my big bag and it leaked through. 
I am assuming they put my small bag on top of my other and it got knocked over and they put it up thinking it was fine.The employees and manager on site said unfortunately there was nothing they can do and I had a friend ask one of the cleaners to at least spray out my work small bag. 
I understand no one wants to admit they dropped the bag but no sorry or any compensation at all for the damages? 
Especially when the rest of our stay was lovely, amazing rooms and we had some good suggestions and bookings from the concierge.Very nice facilities. 
Conference rooms were well kept and professional feeling. 
The room was clean and comfortable. 
Mini bar was practically full sized.We stayed here for our 10 year wedding anniversary. 
They surprised us us with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne. 
It was so so sweet. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful. 
The rooms are modern, but they can use some updating. 
The carpet and the chairs looked a bit worn out. 
Though overall we had a wonderful experience.Very friendly staff at check in, room was impeccable. 
Super comfortable bed. 
Random highlight: super soft bath robes. 
The only downside was a good bit of noise overnight, which I think is expected in any large city. 
Otherwise, wonderful stay...would stay again.Location was prime. 
Rooms were clean and modern, just enough for an overnight stay. 
The 'lil James' service is awesome if traveling with a little one. 
The bed is so comfy! 
From concierge to valet service, A++++. 
Definitely coming back during my next visit.We had a fantastic experience here for my birthday celebration! 
We did the afternoon tea and it was truly divine.  
the service was top notch and the food was absolutely delicious. 
The SCONES were the best I have ever tasted! 
The host even gave my little girl a bear from the gift shop which made her day! 
We cant wait for more family occasions so we can return!
Spent two nights at The Langham in October 2017 with my wife. 
We had a one bedroom suite overlooking the river. 
We have previously stayed at the 4 Seasons, Peninsula, etc., and the Langham is every bit as good, but with a better location and better value. 
The second floor lobby is spectacular, modern but not sterile. 
The room was super quiet, and the bathroom had one of the best showers we have seen.Wow! 
Worthy of a celebrity and from what I hear, a good chance you'll see one! 
Amazing location, impeccable service, rooms are superb but beds almost too soft. 
Great bar and really good food (even room service). 
The bathroom is exactly what you wish you had at home. 
The Langham has thought of everything even down to the trademark scent when you walk in the front door. 
Definitely one of the best hotels in the country! 
I've only stayed at a few five star hotels, but The Langham was likely the best of the bunch. 
The overall attention to detail in the room was fantastic, from decor to technical amenities I was thoroughly impressed. 
Everything about the layout of the room was thoughtful, especially the bathroom. 
It was a great experience and I'll happily stay there again.Lovely rooms, as you'd expect from Langham. 
The spa facilities are nice. 
The pool is OK - I expected it to have a bit more atmosphere, and/or to be offered a cold towel/drinking water pool side; but nothing like that.The Magruder House and Burr Oak Bed and Breakfast are two very nice, relaxing bed and breakfasts in a historical area of Kankakee.The hosts Kyle and Scott could not have been more nice and provided numerous ideas for sights to see in the area. 
Both of the properties (next door to each other) were well decorated, very clean and the breakfast was wonderful.We stayed in the Burr Oak which has a slightly more contemporary feel than the Magruder House which is more victorian / traditional. 
Both properties pay attention to details with a great selection of bath items, bottle water, sodas and snacks including microwave popcorn were provided. 
Within a short walk of the bed and breakfast are two original Frank Lloyd Wright homes, a nice park and a great retro rootbeer stand. 
Downtown Kankakee with a great, small railroad museum is a short five minute drive. 
If you have a boat their is a launch nearby on the Kankakee River. 
I would highly recommend this bed and breakfast when traveling to Kankakee or looking for a weekend escape only about an hour from Chicago. 
The Ritz Carlton Chicago is in a prime location for visiting the city, a block off of the Magnificent Mile and connected to the water tower place. 
The Hancock Center is right next door and you are steps to the lake. 
If you have children (the will offer you a complimentary crib on check-in!) 
the park next door is one of my favorites in the city.The interior was renovated in 2017 and features an incredible art deco lobby. 
The staff is incredibly helpful, in a very noticeable way in this day and age, everyone you meet will offer to exceed your expectations.Not every guest room has received an upgrade yet, so ask the desk if you can have a renovated room when you check in.Having stayed in most hotels in Chicago, this is still my favorite. 
Some extraordinary water views, service that is impeccable and always ahead of the curve. 
Hate cannot go wrong place to stay. 
Get one of the executive suites on the corner and you will be thrilled to pieces and may never leave your room!
Check in is terrible. 
They make you wait wait and wait. 
Plus, they try to give you the worst room they have with nothing like they advertise. 
Call them and ask for another room. 
They have much better rooms. 
They just try fool you. 
Plus, the food is terrible. 
Not worth it at all.I had brunch at the Ritz-Carlton. 
Try the baked eggs they're pretty awesome! 
The service was amazing and every need or consideration was taken care of immediately. 
It is of course, a little pricey, but that's the Ritz.The beauty of this hotel and level of pride of service is definitely breathtaking. 
I had the opportunity of a life time to have a 3 hour tour of this beautiful hotel from Tia, an HR Manager, as well as Joe, the Director of Security. 
We were also able to meet the General Manager along with many of the professionals that run the day to day operations. 
They are currently undergoing a major renovation in their hotel and it is definitely something no one should miss one it is complete. 
Book your hotel rooms now because the Ritz Carlton of Chicago, if not already, will be the best place to stay while traveling. 
Good location, nice staff, but priced high for the size of the rooms. 
Our corner suite had a wall that cut deeply into the shower space as well as some damaged panels. 
There are better options in the area for similar, and sometimes even less, money. 
Business lounge is decent and there are snacks provided. 
Workout centre is better than average, although still on the small side. 
Hotel was very clean.I had a very small room in one of the upper floors. 
Also the stairwells were very tiny. 
I don't want to be there, when everyone tries to rush out in a case of emergency. 
The room was very dark and the windows were  dirty. 
One big plus point: The breakfast was excellent. 
Personally it was the best breakfast I ever had in the US. 
It was very tasty and the staff members were really cool. 
Next time I will stay in another hotel and go there only for breakfast.The hotel was perfect for our stay. 
Right on the river, which made everything to see within walking distance. 
Staff was great, and the amenities were above average. 
Highly recommended.It was a lovely hotel facing the river, sadly our room faced a another boring building. 
It was very clean, very modern, and reasonably comfortable. 
Parking was not clear on their website, and it turned out you have to use their valet service which is all additional $50. 
Aside from the parking, they were very accommodating. 
They have a complimentary luggage storage, so we were able to check out explore the city and then return for our bags and car which saved us the trouble of finding parking downtown. 
It is in a great location, about a 10 min walk to Millennium Park.Room was clean and comfortable. 
The location was extremely convenient and it was only a few minutes walk to the subway, park, and restaurants and bars. 
On my last day, they we're even installing gigabyte internet. 
I would stay here again next time visiting Chicago.Very centrally located with good amenities and a nice lobby. 
Rooms were fine, but could use some updates - and there was a leak in the shower faucet. 
Gym on the third floor was nice and had good equipment. 
Valet parking is $67 a night - which is kinda outrageous, but not more expensive than other places and it does include in and out. 
Breakfast was good - scrambled eggs and hash browns, yogurt, bagels, and some kind sweet rolls - but I was surprised by the lack of proteins (ham, bacon, sausage etc). 
Service was professional and good, but a bit impersonal.We upgraded to a king size bed in our room. 
There were doors slamming all night. 
The alarm at he front door went off for 2 days straight. 
It needs a remodel. 
Staff was accommodating and helpful. 
It is centrally locates so it was easy to get to most places by walking. 
It�s just a little cheaper than the other hotels in the area. 
We will most likely not stay there again.This hotels in an amazing location easily walkable to many of Chicago's downtown destinations.  
The rooms are okay meeting base expectations. 
The lighting in the room could be dramatically improved. 
While the hotel recently renovated its rooms, the bathroom and shower remain in need of attention. 
Finally while the hotel has a lack of amenities , it's location makes up for that as you can get almost anything you need within walking distanceShower water waa not hot enough also the lowest water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed at. 
I paid for a queen bed and got a full bed. 
Air vents in my room we're filthy. 
TV speakers were blown. 
Audio on all channels we're popping. 
Good location that's about it. 
Would not stay there again. 
Oh I asked for an extra room key card and it seemed I ruined the receptionists day.Cute and cozy hotel for those budget friendly travellers. 
The staff are very nice and friendly. 
The location is also is the magnificent mile so it competes with the bigger hotels but with a much friendly priceRooms are nice. 
Location is great. 
Just don't expect courtesy after you leave. 
I left a device in my room. 
Contacted them 4 times trying to get someone to retrieve it for me. 
No response. 
A month later, they said they would check the room. 
OF COURSE, after a month, my device was gone. 
An apology in their much delayed response sure would've been nice!
Fantastic hotel, fantastic view, fantastic room!! 
Love it, I got a corner unit that give me a great view of the river, super cool! 
The check in staff was friendly. 
Hotel even has an executive lounge for platinum members which is rare in Westin. 
Convenient to a lot of local stuff and close to the business district as well. 
Will definitely recommend and come back.Checked in for our one year anniversary. 
Staff was very courteous. 
Hotel was clean and we'll maintained. 
River view is at an angle, but nice. 
Pillows are all very soft and none were even close to firm. 
Valet is $62 per night, but there isn't too much parking around there.Mostly quiet. 
Great views. 
Lots to eat and drink within walking distance. 
Friendly, professional, helpful staff. 
Cozy beds. 
Free WiFi. 
Clean.I don't know how a hotel that charges more offers less. 
No complimentary wifi. 
Happy hour drink prices are double what a restaurant charges for top shelf drinks. 
Room was clean and spacious. 
Toilet ran all night.A nice, clean, hotel in the heart of Michigan Avenue. 
The nicest most professional staff you could ask for. 
They were able accommodate our request for a conjoined room, however we were not able to check-in at the posted check-in time. 
The bellhop staff was incredibly kind and helpful with a baby needing constant entertainment. 
The sheets were a little rough. 
The coffee shop staff in the lobby needs some training.Beautiful rooms! 
Nice staff. 
Decent bar. 
Valet parking. 
Perfect for wedding parties. 
Location is ideal for shopping and exploring downtown.Location central to shops and eateries. 
Staff very friendly and accommodated my early check in request. 
Room was modern but bathroom seemed a bit small...though the rain shower head was awesome!
The room was nice, bed was very comfy, and everything appeared to be clean and in good shape. 
There's not much more you can ask for. 
I also appreciated the 3pm checkout time and Starbucks voucher for eschewing housekeeping.We had a beautiful room with a view of the lake. 
Rain shower and Starbucks coffee in the room, and a full service Starbucks in the lobby. 
The concierge was helpful and and bellhops willing.Although clearly an historic landmark and preserved in (close to?) 
its original form, the Wheeler Mansion leaves much to be deserved around things you might expect at hotel accommodations.1. 
Potable water: When you first arrive (and call the phone number to be let in... 
Which is sadly the *only* way you find out that an employee is on-premise) they try to offer you a small 12 oz bottle of water. 
I refused mine as plastic bottles seem not to be worth their (global) trouble. 
Little did I know that would be the only offer of potable water I would receive the entire time here. 
No carafe or jug of water by the budget Keurig machine and faucets water is the only way to fill those crystal glasses you get in your room. 
Potable water -- in a city whose suburban towns have been in the news for extreme pollution -- seems pretty important, and they don't have it here.2. 
Staff-less: Got a question about where to have dinner? 
One of the 20 different WiFi networks with the name "Wheeler Mansion" in it not working? 
Wondering why your room wasn't cleaned the day before and looking for quick refresher? 
Then you'll need to pick up the phone -- your own, they don't have them in the rooms -- and call someone to emerge from the servant quarters to answer your question.Very nice facility. 
Very nice neighborhood. 
Very friendly staff. 
Very comfortable beds. 
I can't think of any improvement that could be made. 
Perfect for a romantic getaway.My husband and I stayed at the Wheeler Mansion from 12/21/2016 to 12/28/2016. 
Location is great!  
Close to Soldier Field, the museum and aquarium as well as walking distance from restaurants and shopping.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  
So much more personal and individual than staying in a hotel.  
The room was beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. 
The bed had to be the most comfortable bed I ever slept in. 
We were out for most of the day but upon returning to our room it was as neat and clean as the day we checked in.Breakfast Buffet, with an assortment of hot and cold items was plentiful and very good.  
Great way to start the day.Staff was outstanding!  
They were friendly personable, warm and eager to please.  
Cognizant of our privacy yet willing to engage in enjoyable conversation.The entire home was stunning with obvious thought, warmth and personal care in renovations. 
I highly recommend The Wheeler Mansion and intend to stay there again during our next visit to Chicago.I went and saw the hotel during the Open House Chicago weekend and it was fantastic to look at all the details of the architecture.It was a wonderful experience. 
The staff met us at our car and offered to help with luggage. 
The atmosphere was beautiful and the room was very cozy. 
Breakfast was delicious as well.We stayed there last night and We we're very pleased!!!      
Our room was neat and clean !!   
Beautiful PlaceWonderful bed and breakfast. 
Fred and Sally were great. 
We stayed in the Cameo room. 
Breakfast had excellent portions and was great. 
When we went home we looked up how to make the mountain top bacon. 
If we are ever looking for a quick getaway we will check them out again.Great place to stay...owners are amazing!!
This place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!  
The owners are amazing and friendly, the place is clean and neat. 
Love it!
Owners are welcoming, the house is gorgeous, and the breakfast is absolutely divine. 
I was not able to stay at this hotel due to scheduling mix ups and they were already booked but I still have to give them a 5 star for the customer service I experienced. 
At Mei's Corner, Sara was absolutely amazing host and genuinely cared as she made me feel better about my situation as I figured out a solution. 
The valet was also very courteous and waived parking for me instead of charging me for the few hours. 
I truly appreciate all the help I received.The location is great, near the north end of the miricle mile. 
It is easy to get to and easy to get around the city from. 
The staff are very nice. 
The rooms are clean though there are some things that could use an update, the shower curtain is heavy and gross which is an easy change for the hotel to do so I hope it gets done. 
And the carpets could stand to be switched out.Totally not what we thought this place would be when we looked at the pictures online! 
Our room was much smaller than you'd expect for $200 a night but this hotel is basically on the magnificent mile so they can charge more I suppose. 
Their service is good though and we didn't complain and demand another room like some others in our group. 
Also the elevators are very small and only allow 4-5 people at a time in them and there's only two. 
Possibly the worst part is the parking across the street is outrages at $40-$50 a day ouch!!
The staff at the Whitehall are very friendly. 
Be careful about even touching anything in the fridge or snack table unless you are willing to pay for it. 
Everything is weight sensitive so you will be charged regardless if you consume it or not. 
The shower pressure and head could use a lot of help.Nice location, not accommodating staff! 
We arrived and were told they couldn't accommodate our vehicle and gave us zero options. 
Already paid for the hotel room we had to figure out where to take our car, and walk blocks back to the hotel. 
Wouldn't go the extra mile with anything. 
My recommendation would be to spend a little extra to get a higher quality staff! 
We stayed at this hotel because it was very close to the condo my sister and her family live in.  
The hotel is in a decent location: fairly quiet, close to places to eat.  
The staff was very friendly and nice.  
There is a place to unload in front of the hotel and they do give you a parking pass with in/out privileges at a parking ramp down the block.The hotel itself is pretty bare bones.  
The rooms are small and outdated and the lobby is also very small.  
Things were generally clean but old and smelly.  
They have window A/C units and whenever ours turned on cold musty (almost fishy) smelling air blasted into the room.  
There are minimal outlets in the rooms and they are in odd locations.  
The room was very dark and stuffy.  
The bathroom is pretty old and outdated as well; no counter space, trouble with water pressure and hot/cold water.The breakfast provided was sparse (fruit and pastries).    
There was only one small area to sit at to eat it.  
Many people were sitting on benches and curbs outside to eat their breakfast.  
We ended up opting to eat our breakfast elsewhere rather than uncomfortably perch on the curb to eat it.They do provide coffee/tea 24/7 which was nice.Although this was an okay place to sleep no one in my family wanted to spend any extra time in the dark and musty room and there weren't any other areas to go and sit in.  
The walls are very thin so it's very easy to hear the people around you as well which woke us up a number of times during the night.At nearly $300/night I expected a lot more.   
We won't be staying here again.Lovely neighborhood for a small, boutique hotel. 
Rooms are comfortable but no view. 
Real glasses in room with options to purchase wine and soft drinks from mini bar but no liquor. 
Nice staff. 
Breakfast is basic fare with no eggs, not even hard boiled.Nice ambiance although our room was tiny. 
It's to be expected as it was for only one person. 
The bathroom was a good size with a nice shower/bath and to be honest it had nice shampoo. 
Parking was horrible, though. 
Make sure you enter the parking garage from diversey street, not through the alley next to the hotel.European style hotel, nice room, with a good view. 
Very clean and organized, good location, located off the Lincoln park neighborhood. 
Walking distance to the park and the lake to oversee the skylines of Chicago. 
Staff is friendly, parking garage is close by and easily accessible. 
I will highly recommend this place to everybody.Great location and exterior but rooms feel tired and bathrooms need remodelling. 
Needs more electrical outlets in rooms.  
Standard breakfast options- could have more health conscious offerings.Wonderful hotel. 
If I could give a 6 star review I would. 
For starters the staff is so welcoming and helpful. 
My girlfriend and I had never been to Chicago and the staff provided excellent recommendations and even helped out with the little things. 
The employees are kind and seem to really care about your experience. 
Great location our view was beautiful.It was really nice. 
My childhood friend was married on the roof and had his reception in a hall on the third floor. 
It was pretty upscale but not stuffy. 
The staff was very friendly. 
The food was very good, but the dessert was spectacular. 
It was a nice and ample spread both on the roof and at the reception. 
Also, the roof is an exclusive nightclub in the evening. 
The women in line were gorgeous!! 
There's a lot to see on the streets around the wit. 
It's right next to that famous CHICAGO sign from the intro of Perfect Strangers. 
I heard the rooms were nice, but I was super distracted. 
I had been ditched at dinner by some of my best friends and they felt no need to apologise. 
It's been tearing up inside. 
I know they were happy with their stay. 
Oh, and the concierge will tell you the cheapest and best lot to park at. 
It's on Randolph and State. 
Very useful information.Amazing Hotel.  
Beautiful decor, service was amazing.  
The suites are well worth the upgrade.  
We stayed over a weekend and was able to wall for everything we did.  
It is in the middle of everything theaters, shopping and food.  
Bed was super comfy.  
This was our second time at this hotel and have booked another double tree property in St Louis.  
Hope its as nice as ChicagoGreat hotel.  
You cannot beat proximity to downtown attractions and the train, especially for the price.  
The staff here were extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and more than accommodation.  
I booked through a 3rd party website, and the website screwed up my reservation, but the gentleman at the front desk was nice enough to let me check in at 4 AM the morning of my reservation.  
Will definitely be staying here again.The room my husband and I stayed in was fairly large with a decent view of the city. 
You could also see parts of the navy pier. 
I was not a big fan of the valet charge but we only stayed for the night. 
They were very accommodating. 
We were able to check in about two hours early which was a big relief after a long drive.Beautiful hotel. 
Location was good, but I was most impressed with my corner room. 
Gorgeous views of downtown and the lake, tastefully furnished with an amazing bathroom-I was definitely happy. 
My only complaint would the price of overnight valet-$68! 
If I hadn't arrived at 11PM in a rain storm i would have figured out self parking, but I bit the bullet and paid the price. 
Overall though, I was very happy and will stay there again when I get the chance to come back to ChicagoWent for a wedding. 
Absolutely beautiful venue, delicious food. 
Cash bar and drinks were $14, even beer, which was outrageous. 
Wedding block rooms were $250 after taxes, which was also pricey but more expected I'd say. 
We heard rooms normally are around $370, which is too much.Great amenities and fantastic customer service. 
They were very accommodating with my early arrival. 
The room was clean, modern, and had an amazing view of Rush Street.The Thompson Hotel was a wonderful place to stay. 
The staff is very helpful and quite accommodating. 
The rooms are very nice and spacious. 
Had a wonderful experience.
�Great Location, beautiful hotel�This hotel is in a great location surrounded by restaurants with outdoor seating that are open late on a warm summer night. 
Also at the end of the Magnificent Mile and a short drive to other sights. 
The hotel itself feels intimate and classy. 
Rooms are clean and well appointed. 
Service was great. 
I highly recommend.Our stay at Thyme for Bed was both fun and restful. 
The owners were so hospitable and welcoming. 
The rooms were comfy and clean. 
The board games and snacks available were an unexpected treat!
We had such an amazing time! 
And the owners made us feel like family! 
We have recommended this place to everyone since we got back!
9-9-17I HIGHLY recommend everyone to check this place out if in the area.  
The place is fabulous and has a homey feel.. the owners were great people and took care of us well!!!. 
If I'm ever in area again will definitely stay here!!!
Great place! 
Friendly atmosphere, quiet and romantic getaway in a unique placeThoroughly enjoy our stay. 
Great place wonderful hosts.Sybil working the front desk on Sept 18 was amazing.  
Kind, polite, cheerful and welcoming.   
This woman is a shining example of perfect customer facing personality.  
Next time I come back here she better be running this place or at the very least have a giant raise to show for her hard work and incredible efforts at flawless service.Really felt like I wasn't in joliet with how nice this place was inside. 
Super clean and extremely friendly staff. 
Rooms were spacious with a lot to offer. 
Hidden gem in such a crumby city.Wonderful room, delicious continental breakfast and free cigarette smoke coming through your bathroom fan! 
Keep your fan on and there is no problem. 
Great pool and hot tub too!
Room had a strange smell.  
Front desk staff were very nice. 
Breakfast was more than enough. 
Cat friendly hotel.Very nice room!  
Clever design and furnishings for the business or long-term traveler.Super comfortable and a great central location.  
An older building with the double edged sword of being near the El Train (convenient, yet audible at night, but very muffled).  
It has been updated and very clean and convenient within the central loop.  
Close to Millennium Park and many other places.The staff was friendly and helpful.My stay at the Travelodge Hotel was fairly average. 
Staff was nice enough, the room was not too dirty. 
I really only had two issues. 1. 
No channel guide for the TV. 
With about 40 available channels spread across 1-99, you have to go through each channel one at a time to figure out what's what. 2. 
The fitted sheet was not a fitted sheet and did not cover the whole bed, meaning my feet kept touching the mattress pad. 
It was weird but I was able to get over it. 
On the positive side, the hotel is super close to a lot of attractions and it is very affordable.We very much enjoyed our stay here! 
Our hotel room was clean, and the front desk allowed us to "check" a bag for the day after check out so we could explore before heading to the airport. 
A word of caution - we ordered too much deep dish pizza and didn't realize we didn't have a refrigerator or microwave for leftovers. 
On the second of our 4 night stay, we told room service that we were okay without service for the day, and I believe she took that as we didn't need room service for the rest of our stay. 
Our fault, but we wish we would have communicated better.The location is great, and the rooms are nice and clean. 
The people from the hotel was nice too, and it has a great place for breakfast in the next door. 
The only issues was the noise. 
Is close to the subway, so you can hear it since very early in the morning if your room face it. 
Beds are not amazing neither. 
But overall it was a good experience! 
I would stay again.The rooms were a bit small and some may need some renovating but we were able to get some sleep in comfortably. 
Bed was comfortable enough and the staff was super friendly. 
One thing I do wish for is the shower to have a little more pressure.I�ve lived at Tri-Star in the past and made a lot of memories there. 
Since moving back here a year and a half ago and I've noticed Tri-Star added the basketball courts and upgraded the parks and is a great addition for the kids here. 
Tri-Star Estates is a very family friendly environment with a lot fun activities for the whole family to enjoy year-round at the clubhouse. 
I am very happy with living here and would recommend moving here!
I would give it 5 stars if the home we are renting was fully done, but they are keeping us informed about everything. 
The process was very easy and quick. 
The maintenance response is great too. 
We are loving our new home and neighborhood. 
The neighborhood is very friendly and welcoming.My wife and I came into Tri-Stars Estates on September 5 , 2016 to look at some homes they had on line and the sales people where VERY knowledgeable and we're very understanding of our needs.  
We did buy a home for ourselves and our 8 and 10 year old and have been here for 3 months now and are very pleased with ALL the office personal, management. 
The kids love in here.Rude staff, & The absolute most in organized office/ administration I've ever seen. 
Constantly miss informed. 
Haven't even been here a year, and plan to move as soon as lease is up! 
I've never known a leasing company to be so unorganized and apparently according to management, the front office and back office were telling people two different stories about our lease agreement and miss informed us. 
Now we're stuck here until December. 
Terrible. 
If you read other reviews, you will see this has been an ongoing issue. 
Don't waste your money and time to be scammed!
Properties are to small.  
Neighbors can see in your window if the blinds are open.  
There is no privacy.  
It is clean and? 
neat also a park and pool.  
Also offers a place for private parties.Simply beautiful! 
Absolutely loved staying here! 
Spotlessly clean rooms, excellent service and amazing food! 
Top it all off with a gorgeous view! 
My husband and I will definitely be back, soon!
I went to the Trump Terrace to meet a friend for drinks and to catch up. 
It's a beautiful Terrace that overlooks the Tribune Tower clock and the other beautiful historic buildings surrounding. 
The food is blas�... nothing to write home about ...when I got there my table was filthy but the servers eventually got it cleaned up and were friendly. 
Strangely enough, the day that I was there (10/3/17), there was a Madman in the restaurant tearing up the restaurant area... very odd... but I was outside on the Terrace and had no clue it was happening... it's just interesting that he was even able to get up there, past the front desk, onto that floor and create such a debacle. 
The Terrace to still a beautiful place to meet and have drinks and relax but as far as food goes, there are plenty of other great restaurants in the city of Chicago to eat at.I have been here many times including the Grand Opening.  
It was the best simply the best..  
Service was outstanding, the rooms were clean and the sheets were soft.. 
Unfortunately Mr. 
Trump dropped the ball in the few years The Trump Tower was built.   
The sheets were rough as if they stopped using fabric softener, the bathroom doors has little privacy as its a sliding stained glass door with a 3 inch gap on the closing side that basically lets you see the toilet directly i don't like that.  
The place is clean but to the standards of Trump international hotels not up to par. 
Basicly the staff is slacking off.  
Not saying its still not one of the best places to stay because it is. 
But I had hoped this hotel would of kept up the high standards that The Trump International Hotels keepMy wife and I had a really fun visit here and met some really neat locals. 
Sitting on the terrace on the 14th floor and enjoying the view, we landed on a warm, sunny day with Blue Angels practicing for the weekend air and water show. 
A couple of Chicago beers were on draft, and they had a really nice bottled cider selection from Seattle that wasn't overpriced. 
Didn't try the food. 
My wife had a spa day and really enjoyed it. 
Every staff member along the way was highly professional and friendly. 
This place definitely has all of the high-scale vibes of a 5-star location. 
Kudos!
From the moment you walk in the building you�ll notice something different. 
The difference is world-class service trained qualified employees who take their job extremely seriously. 
If you doubt me, just stop by the concierge desk and ask them any questions they will help you regardless of what your needs might be.We were really excited to camp here with our 7 year old niece because of all of the activities that are listed on the website (canoes, paddle boats, climbing wall, archery, etc). 
We waited around for the management on Saturday morning to find out about the activities, but they never showed up.  
We asked the "host" and she said that the activities are only available for holiday weekends and large groups.  
We were really disappointed, as were other campers that had specifically spoken to the management about doing the activities on that weekend.  
We wished we had stayed at Kankakee State Park, which had much nicer scenery and hiking trails and was also cheaper.Great location! 
I was here for a week for work. 
Hotel is a bit dated for a W. 
Check in was being done by 1 person and I had a request before for early check in. 
Still had to wait 2.5 hrs and no one notified me. 
I was given a room that smelt bad. 
Upon request they changed my room which was slightly bigger, but overall a king bed room is tiny and less space. 
I personally would be spending my money on a newer hotel which has bigger rooms and better service.I was visiting my son in Chicago. 
I loved staying at W. 
Personnel was very friendly and helpful. 
Location was great! 
Rooms were clean and cozy. 
Bathroom was small but I did not need a lot of counter space and it did not bother us. 
They could use firmer pillows though but it was not a problem because I stayed there only for 3 nights.Stayed at W Chicago-City Center for a weekend getaway. 
This hotel is one of the best as far as location , it is close to must see places . 
The decor is  amazing- giant lampshade upon entering the lobby. 
The staff are helpful .Special mention to concierge Eden Bernal - this hotel is lucky to have her. 
We enjoyed Chicago and maximized our stay because of her recommendations on which tour to join, and what activities to prioritize, where to go for  best blues bar in town , etc. 
We plan to come back  here!!
There are lots of great hotel choices in Chicago.  
This is not one of them.  
The room needed renovation.  
When we turned on the air conditioner, it banged loudly.  
When we asked to be moved to a quiet room, we were told that we would have to pay more.  
We paid hundreds of dollars for four hours sleep.  
We won' t be back.Later found out that they tried to charge us for an umbrella that they loaned us, and which we returned.  
AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!!
A modern hotel has been placed into an older building. 
In the lobby this means an Asian fusion restaurant has spilled over. 
In the elevators a cool blue hue and holographic bubbles. 
The old bones show once you leave the lobby and you can see where the fresh coats of paint attempt to obscure. 
The room is a modern wonderland of chic white cabinets, over priced mini bars, and a shadow box illuminating an inspirational quote to help you sleep.We enjoyed this hotel immensely! 
They allowed us an early check-in and a late check-out. 
The room looked exactly like the photos. 
They were extremely spacious and CLEAN. 
I'm VERY particular about cleanliness, and it was spot on. 
The view from the 30th floor was breathtaking over the Navy Pier. 
We were walking distance from so much! 
The Pier, shopping, great food. 
The location is PERFECT.The complimentary coffee had ended one morning, but one of the ladies still went and grabbed me a cup (and it was strong and delicious!) 
The staff was really great and attentive. 
Not to mention, everyone was well dressed and polished. 
The only downside is the pool. 
It doesn't look as up to date or polished as the rest of the hotel. 
I wish they would update it and create a better ambiance. 
But that doesn't take away the amazing experience. 
Thank you for showing me why people love the W so much!
If not for the wonderful view and location I would have rated a 3 star. 
For the price and advertised rating the room is sub par. 
I even had the upgraded room just under a suite. 
The bathroom was huge disappointment. 
If anyone from the W reads this a rainfall shower head should come out of the ceiling not the wall. 
Causing you to have to stand in the drain to get wet. 
Bed was comfortable and the view was tremendous. 
Room service was slow and 28 dollar Cheese tray had about 5 pieces of cheese 6 pieces of bread and some almonds. 
No vending machines but they do have a small room near check in with a very limited selection of over priced snacks and coke products. 
If you can get a deal stay here but not at full price.I was very excited to stay at such a beautiful hotel. 
From the moment we walked in the experience was not the greatest. 
The hotel check-in clerk seemed confused about my reservation and delayed the process of my husband and I getting into the room. 
He excused himself and failed to tell us why he left us standing there. 
After 10 minutes, he returned and advised us of why he did what he did. 
Once we were finally in our room, we later requested a meal off of the menu located in the room. 
The desk clerk advised us that we had the wrong menu. 
We requested an updated dinner menu and a toothbrush from room service. 
After 25 minutes of waiting, I had to place another call and put in my request again. 
The hotel is beautiful, the room is very modern and spacious, but the customer service I've experienced thus far will be the reason I won't be coming back.This is one classy hotel. 
The views are amazing and service really nice. 
I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 pm, about 3 hours early for check-in, and the hotel staff was nice enough to let me check in. 
Rooms are comfortable, spacious and well appointed. 
Bathroom is spacious with all the toiletries.I ordered breakfast, once on the day of arrival and once before check out. 
I tried the steak and eggs with pineapple juice and a pot of coffee, and eggs Benedict with pineapple juice. 
Food was priced at a slightly higher rate. 
I paid $68 for eggs and steak and $36 for eggs Benedict. 
The overall bill was $400 for a night's stay including breakfast.Also, the hotel has most amazing views of the navy pier and is a short walk away from the main shopping district.Beds have very firm mattresses and the blackout curtains do not completely black out the room. 
Staff would benefit from some hospitality training. 
The bar serves some wonderful drinks but the restaurant�s offerings and service could use some help. 
Great location with wonderful views.It was a great hotel and great location. 
The rooms where very small though. 
Everyone was very friendly. 
My only complaint is the elevators were slow and sometimes it took upwards of 5 min to get an elevator. 
They are doing work to improve those so hopefully in the future it's faster. 
It would also be nice if the bar were open later than midnight on the weekends.I will start my review with two facts: I am a frequent traveler as well as an independent hotelier.My boyfriend booked a standard room to celebrate my birthday with a visit to Chicago, and I could not have been more pleased. 
It's not a 5-star hotel, so 5-star attentiveness should not be expected; the other negative reviews give me the impression those guests are simply ill-informed or demand way too much for the price point.Highlights:The bartender (Mark? 
I can't remember, but he has a ponytail) was phenomenal, as are the signature cocktails.Staff member, Tammy, could be seen throughout the premises and was always friendly.All of the staff, as a matter of fact, were friendly and happy to help with questions. 
(I had a lot of them.)The location is perfect - near all of the restaurants and shops the Magnificent Mile has to offer.In summary:Yes, this is an old, historic building; the elevators are slow, and rooms are small, but if you're out enjoying the Chicago during the day, you will not want for much. 
The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was updated and the entire space was clean.The hotel is gorgeous but it is old. 
And the only reason I point that out is because the evelatpr situation leaves something to be desired. 
There are 3 small elevators that service all 24 floors. 
It takes awhile to get an elevator which gets irritating but there is nothing that can be done about it other than planning for it. 
Leave extra time for you to get places or be willing to hike the stairs. 
The wedding location is beautiful and everyone is really helpful though.Extremely friendly and accommodating staff. 
One of the rooms we booked was beautiful. 
The other room on a lower floor was extremely dated and in desperate need of renovations. 
The springs were piercing in the pull-out sofa bed and the view was of a brick wall. 
Very convenient location in the centre of the city.It was a one night stay, so we barely were in the room except to sleep. 
The room was on the small side but it fit our budget. 
I will say the bed was surprisingly short, and I'm only 5'2", so that's saying something. 
The rooms were clean and had a vintage/modern vibe. 
Our room was facing Michigan Ave, so perfect location for our needs. 
Overall it was a great place to sleep and I'd chose it again.My stay has been pleasant so far. 
It has been very quiet and no problems. 
There are various stores and restaurants in walking distance. 
The only downfall is no kitchen. 
But overall, the rooms are very nice and clean. 
And the prices are great :)BEWARE!!!!! 
I would give this zero stars if it would let me.  
Made a reservation at this place via booking.com. 
Specified I was paying with MasterCard and verified they had 24 hour front desk. 
I arrived around midnight and had to ring the door bell and knock on the window several times before someone answered. 
I was greeted by a lady that spoke very little English, I tried to give her my license to check in and she immediately said "no". 
I explained that I had made a reservation online and wanted to check in. 
All she could really say was no and kept pointing at the window. 
Ended up having to drive 20 minutes out of my way to stay at another hotel. 
I contacted the owner of the property the next day to express my anger and make sure my card wouldn't be charged for missing the reservation. 
He then told me the lady up front can't work the credit card machine, she can only check in with cash. 
The owner seemed to not care about my problem at all and made me feel like it was my fault that I could not check in. 
Overall it was an absolutely terrible experience and I ended up having to pay almost double the price for a different hotel.The owners are very nice and the rooms were clean. 
There isn't a lot of storage space, especially in the kitchenette, but it's more than workable. 
Pet friendly.I travel for work and stay in cheaper hotels to save money and this one by far is one of the worst, got a kitchenette and stove is broken, fridge was full of water and not plugged in, everything has food stains on it, floor hasn't been mopped in a month throughout the whole room, bathroom smells like mold and water reeks of iron, two thumbs down, won't ever stay here again and would never recommend, one star is to muchSmall, clean and good price.The hotel is nice enough. 
Breakfast was really good. 
However, the beds are very hard and uncomfortable. 
The bathroom also wasn't very clean. 
My biggest problem though was the streetlights in the parking lot outside my room. 
They were like stadium strength spotlights! 
And there were so many of them! 
Even with the blinds closed, it looked like it was daytime outside. 
And they are pointed right at the windows of the rooms. 
It just seemed so excessive and made sleeping there less enjoyable.This is the best hotel in town. 
Got a first class treatment from the friendly staff .Manager and staff are on point. 
Bed and breakfast was top notch. 
Keep up the good workGreat stay. 
Best part of it it shared a parking lot with the most amazing place to eat. 
Side Street American Tavern. 
We ate there everyday we stayed at hotel. 
Amazing must try!!!
I was in for a family wedding this past weekend. 
By the time I finished work on Friday, caught my flight, landed in Chicago, got my rental vehicle and got to the hotel I was exhausted. 
Ms. 
Amy Quinn checked me in and noticed I hadn't used my Wyndham club # when making my reservation, so she added it so I could get the points. 
The next morning she helped me as I was having trouble logging onto the computer to to secure my outbound seat. 
She also noticed I was about an hour early trying to check in. 
That's when I realized I was still on east coast time. 
We both laughed about my internal clock error. 
Over the course of the weekend she was kind and helpful more than a few times due to my east coast setting. 
It became something of a joke between us. 
She added to an all-ready pleasurable  weekend with her sense of humor. 
I'll stay here again later this summer during another family event, just so I can thank her personally for making this trip so wonderful!!
Nice staff, great room, and comfortable bed. 
Nice hot breakfast in the morning, including made to order automatic pancake machine ?! 
Lunch and dinner have no fear there is a great grill restaurant 50ft from the parking lot. 
Definitely will stay there when I'm in the area again!
