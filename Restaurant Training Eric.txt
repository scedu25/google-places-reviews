-1  We felt bad for her because she seemed to be swamped and stressed.
+1  Excellent! 
-1 I admit I went in expecting a long wait given how busy they were and slow to seat people. 
+1   However they handled it well! 
+1  Didn't take long to get my food once seated. 
+1  Plus it was cooked to perfection and exactly how I ordered it. 
+1  Great Denny's! 
+1  This place has greatly improved. 
+1  The manager Ashly is a wonderful loving person and I personally was blessed to spend some time and chat with her. 
+1  She strives to satisfy her patrons and provide a friendly atmosphere with quality food and service.
0   I work a dedicated route here and usually eat breakfast here 3 to 4 times a week.
0   I'm here quite a bit. 
-1  Service is very very very below poor. 
-1  Sorry ladies you ain't getting no tip from me. 
-1  The only way I even come here is to sit and visit with friends. 
-1  I thought maybe after the remodel it might get better, but no. 
-1  Service is beyond poor. 
-1  It's obvious the management don't care it all bleeds down from the top.. 
-1  I do apologise for a crappy review, but it is what it is..Ordered pizza for our late night cravings on the Dominos app. 
+1  Super freaking easy to use. 
+1  I made special instructions to not ring the doorbell because I've got kids sleeping, and the delivery guy, Matthew, was awesome enough to call us when he was coming up the street to make sure he didn't wake the kids. 
+1  Freaking awesome. 
+1  Chatted with him about his night, and he's honestly the nicest delivery guy my friend and I have ever met. 
+1  His wife and kids should be proud
+1  Good job Matthew . 
+1  OH AND THE PIZZA IS GREAT ?
0   We use the app to order almost weekly. 
+1  Love it and love Dominos!  
+1  Quality has improved and the prices can't be beat.
+1  Michael the delivery guy is cute af and it made my day. 
+1  Thank you very muchOrdered from here 5 or 6 times and it has always been good. 
+1  Your not going to get a $20+ pizza for $8 but you will get a very good $8 pizza.
-1  So far, my boy ceaser that's supposed to be delivering this pizza and garlic knots isn't here from a 2.2 mile destination after like 20 minutes of saying he was on the way. 
-1  Wth Ceaser, we really counted on you. ** UPDATE** so freaking Ceaser just cancelled our dang order. 
0  Dang Ceaser. 
-1  We are so disappointed. 
-1  And to think I almost had faith and gave you three stars.
+1  The hotel staff was very friendly. 
-1  No complimentary breakfast.  
+1  The breakfast buffet was delicious and you get quite a bit for $11.99. 
+1  They also give free warm and soft cookies..... on another note, they hold $50 per night. 
-1  We kept seeing little brown ants in our room on the wall.  
-1  I thought the price was too high due to not having a microwave or refrigerator in the room. 
0   The Evian bottle of water in the room is $4, so drink up if you want. 
+1  Pillows are extremely soft. 
0   They do offer cots. 
0   Must wear wristband to get in pool.
+1  The room was amazing and closer to the highway than we expected. 
+1  Staff and associates were helpful with directions and hospitality. 
+1  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. 
-1  Wish they had a microwave in room to re-warm cookies. 
+1  But other than that, amazing stay!!!!
+1  Hotel stay was comfortable. 
-1  NOT at all happy with transportation from airport. 
-1  Returned flight,, called hotel at 7:45 pm for "shuttles on the hour" only to find that it was going to be 50 minutes. 
0   Then I was asked if I was going to wait for it. 
0   I replied, what choice do I have, my car is in your parking lot. 
0   To which I was told that I could take a taxi. 
-1  So, I spent another 40$ on a cab ride. 
-1  Should be called park and get stranded.  
-1  WORST park and fly experience ever. 
-1  Stick to hotels because the transportation end sucks.
+1  The on site restaurant was cozy even though they had a wedding going on. 
0   We sat in the bar. 
+1  Service was slow that night, but the food was very good and worth the wait. 
0   We had the taco salad with chicken. 
+1  All of us like it as an appetizer, then burgers. 
+1  Definitely a nice time. 
+1  I would go again.
+1  My son's Wedding was held here...beautiful ceremony and beautiful room for the reception. .food was exceptional as was the wait help. ..I will look to hold any occasion at the Double Tree..
+1  I know they will give me excellent service.
+1  Who can beat Dairy Queen ice cream. 
+1  Love their hot fudge. 
+1  Had a molten lava cake That was very good. 
+1  Clean location The staff knows me. 
+1  I would be embarrassed  (I eat a LOT of blizzards), but I almost find it endearing. 
0   They also tend to get really excited when I pull up with my dogs, and they give us pup cups.
+1  Fresh and fast. 
+1  Can really tell a good  difference in the food since a couple years ago.
+1  Great food quality and it took about 2 minutes for our group of 5 people to receive our food. 
+1  Great visit overall.
+1  This DQ has always been great as far as i remember. 
+1  I have always had great service and they seats are always clean. 
+1  I love the outside seating. 
0   My favorite meal is the chicken fingers 5 buck lunch with the upgrade to a blizzard. 
0   I've been here a couple of times. 
-1  The music is always loud but the second time it was just too loud. 
-1  Not a fan of that. 
+1  Ordered the sweet potato fries and the regular fries, both were great with a nice mayo dip. 
-1  Would have liked more dip as there were lots of fries. 
0   Will update review once I actually eat something there. 
+1  This place was great. 
+1  Just a nice casual neighborhood bath with good prices and specials. 
+1  Ben the bartender was great to meet and talk to. 
+1  They had a pretty great playlist playing (lots of indie rock) before the dj showed up, who switched to remixes of top 40 as the crowd shifted. 
-1  Would have preferred the indie rock but not a big deal, later night crowd probably doesn't. 
+1  All in all though I had a great experience here.  
+1  Cheap, tasty food and drinks via friendly and attentive service. 
0   Just a bar. 
0   Nothing more, nothing less. 
+1  With Three Aces gone, this could be one of the better ones on Taylor Street. 
+1  Pretty random crowd when I was there (early-mid evening) - some old regulars, some super young college kids, which is pretty cool. 
0   On the other hand, there was a DJ setting up at around 11 when I was heading out, so it likely flips heavy college crowd late night. 
+1  Love the food and service, everyone is always so friendly! 
+1  The food is amazing here.  
+1  If you want really good homemade Cole slaw, then this is the place you're looking for.  
+1  I had the grilled pork tenderloin sandwich (aka the Naked Pygmy) and my husband had the smoked chicken breast sandwich (sorry, don't remember the name of it) and both were amazing!  
+1  Also, the bartender is very friendly - even to newbies like us!  
+1  Come and enjoy an afternoon or evening out here!  
+1  You'll enjoy it! 
+1  Love it! 
+1  Awesome food and Awesome service! 
+1  It doesn't look like much on the outside but the ambiance on the inside is awesome. 
+1  A lot of items are smoked..tasty. 
+1  Definitely a place you can kick back and relax.  
+1  The help are friendly and don't rush you. 
0   At one time this was a bank and you can go into what was once the vault. 
0   EVERY entre features smoked meat. 
-1  Smoked meat is NOT a favorite of mine, though it was ok here,  I"d have preferred something NOT smoked! 
0   I was with other people and had no choice of dining. 
-1  Please offer something for those of us who don't like smoked meat! 
+1  Amazing food , good atmosphere .....Always a good drink and or food special.  
+1  Bartenders Rock !
0   Went for a private event. 
-1  Worst mixed drinks I've ever had. 
-1  Bartenders were rude.
-1  The service and management what a joke. 
-1  The server we had took for ever to come to our table that we had to order our drinks at the bar. 
-1  Then when we told the gerneral manager what had happened didn't care nor did he wanna compensate for what we had to go thru. 
-1  I was like wow this is a joke right and he said no next time go somewhere else
+1  Great staff great menu and drink specials every night. 
+1  Friendly atmosphere and fun crowd
0   Went for brunch. 
-1  The deal is AMAZING for drinks, but the food is mediocre at best.
0   No frills sports bar with a casual vibe. 
0   Came here for the p popular Sunday brunch which includes unlimited Mimosas and beer and includes an unlimited brunch buffet. 
+1  The food ok, nothing to mouth-watering but for 25 bucks, it's definitely worth it. 
+1  If gets packed and loud during the time which gives it a lively feel. 
+1  Great service by the waitress and food was good.  
+1  Drinks were decent.  
-1  The bouncers though are basically giant idiots pumped up on steroids.  
-1  While violently removing a patron one of these grunts knocked into me.  
-1  I was on crutches so it's fairly easy to lose my balance and landed into one of their slot machines.  
-1  No apologies given and landed on my broken foot.  
-1  I will never return because of their desire to use violence over diplomacy.
+1  Ordered delivery and got a fresh hot pizza within half the time of my expected delivery. 
+1  Best pizza I've had in a while!
+1  Yes this place is a local dive bar but service here is always above amazing. 
+1  Everyone is so friendly, plus the place is clean and they have a great outside patio. 
+1  Pizza is pretty good also. 
+1  Another great plus is that you cannot beat the drink prices. 
+1  I would definitely recommend this.
+1  Great place to hangout with friends. 
+1  The food is perfect and the service is outstanding.
+1  Food was Great. 
+1  Drink was Delicious. 
+1  Service was Awesome.
-1  Entrance foyer gets crowded during lunch people are trying to pay as others are trying to get seated from the same girl. 
-1  They should push the seating 4 feet back and the entrance would be more welcoming. 
0   I ordered a chicken breast  dish which was a butterflied to ensure it is cooked thoroughly. 
-1  The texture was rubber and I could tell it was the solution injected type. 
0   Salt water solution.  
-1  Waiter could barely communicate in English and was pushy to get my order. 
-1  This was my first and last visit.
+1  The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the room itself is fantastic. 
+1  The high ceilings make it feel so much larger. 
+1  The food was delicious and there are several options for any type of eater. 
-1   The lay out when you first walk in is cramped if the restaurant is busy, but manageable. 
+1  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. 
+1  I would recommend stopping in!
0   Having grown up in Southern California, I was used to excellent, authentic Mexican food. 
0   I've lived in the Midwest for 20 years and eaten at doses of restaurants. 
+1  This is the only Mexican restaurant that meets my high standards. 
+1  I love the food and the team at El Mexicano!
+1  I love to eat and it is very hard to fill me up and this place did it in  one plate!! 
+1  I highly recommend this place if you want your money's worth.
+1  A little out of the way, but worth the drive.
+1  Really a nice place to visit. 
+1  The waiter who served us had very good knowledge about everything in the menu. 
+1  Everything was nice and tidy. 
+1  Food was delicious, especially the british beer was amazing! 
+1  Definitely a go go!
+1  Usually have several really good beers on tap.  
+1  From what I recall they also have a decent scotch selection.   
+1  Its got a nice interesting atmosphere as well.
+1  One of the better and cheaper casual dining restaurants in the loop. 
+1  It's not haute cuisine, but there are a variety of British and American themed comfort foods available with a little something for everybody. 
+1  Good appetizers, soup and salad variety in addition to main courses, all good food at good value. 
+1  A great stop when you're travel-weary and need a warm meal late in the evening.
+1  The food was good, if not a bit over priced for the quality.  
0   Standard British menu items.  
0   The beer selection was adequate but not outstanding.  
-1  They had all of the standard beers to be sure, but their "craft selection was limited to the standard stuff.  
0   I didn't notice and unique beers from the UK.
-1  Went for breakfast service was good, typical breakfast, though the banger tasted as if they spilled a jar of pepper in it.  
0   Pricing is about average for the city ( higher than normal for everywhere else)
-1  HORRIBLE. 
-1  Soooo disappointed. 
0   Had been coming here every so often and did at the time enjoy the food. 
0   WOW ! 
-1  Has it ever changed and not for the good.  
-1  I took my daughter their for dinner and the quality of the food was terrible. 
-1  The perch was soggy, the rice was overcooked as were the beans. 
-1  They she had a dead FLY in her soup. 
0   When we showed the waiter he had this shocked look on his face. 
-1  He took it and walked away and didn't come back for like 10 minutes, laid down the check and said thank you. !!!!! 
0   WHAT!!!  
-1  No manager, No, I'm sorry,  No discount, Didn't even ask how our food was or if we wanted dessert. 
-1  Will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN !!!!!
0   This is an attempt to bring casual dining mixed with fine dining atmosphere. 
-1  Casual dress is ok, you will pay fine dining prices and not as good food.
-1  We were pretty bummed. 
-1  The menu didn't match what was online either. 
+1  Good service though. 
-1  Save your money go to another place.
+1  We could not have had a more pleasant brunch. 
+1  The staff was amazing. 
+1  The buffet was great. 
+1  The staff constantly prepared fresh food for the buffet. 
+1  My friend, myself, and our kids loved this place. 
+1  We had terrible experice at jellys the weekend prior, so Fahrenheit two twelve definitely restored our confidence in visiting local restaurants. 
+1  Thanks to staff for our awesome experience!!
+1  Amazing food and amazing service! 
+1  Best Lake perch and prime rib we've ever had. 
+1  Reasonable prices and nice atmosphere as well.
+1  I love this place! 
+1  The food is great! 
+1  I had a very attentive and sweet Waitress!  
+1  We had the perch and it was delicious!
+1  The best tasting BBQ ribs I have ever had. 
0   We always order naked ribs. 
+1  The chicken was also very good. 
+1  The sides were tasty. 
-1  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service. 
-1  One of us is diabetic and we asked for some crackers before we got the meal...and you guessed right ... we did not get until it was pointed out. 
-1  Only bad part of our visit was that we were waiting at the hostess stand for a couple of minutes before someone helped us. 
0   Our food was also apparently slow to be served, because they gave us $5 off and free dessert. 
0   Not that we had noticed or were in a hurry to  eat, but we didn't argue. 
+1  Food itself was great; basic BBQ menu but well prepared. 
+1  I had the spare ribs, excellent; my wife had the cedar plank salmon, good; my son had the beef tips, good. 
+1  Free dessert was the bread pudding, incredible. 
-1  Be warned: just reading the calorie counts on the menu is enough to give you a heart attack.
+1  I will say the food was amazing!! 
-1  The only reason why I'm eating it so low was our server. 
-1  Between her comments about her baby, ignoring us, and making comments about how she didn't want to be there I don't know what was worse. 
-1  When we first got there she said how she wouldn't eat anything on the menu because her baby wasn't feeling it.  
-1  We had to ask the host on 2 occasions to please get us refills. 
-1  What was the worst is we waited for 10 minutes to get our check and it was like there was no one in the whole restaurant. 
-1  When our server came back she made a comment that she was cleaning in the back so she didn't notice that we were done. 
-1  The food was amazong but a bad server ruined our experience. 
+1  We may try this place again due to the amazing food and the bang for your buck. 
-1  The server we had definitely needs more trainning.
+1  I've come to this place several times and it has always had a very chill atmosphere. 
+1  Friendly staff and good food.
+1  I'm definitely gonna keep making the drive to the one on L street because of the customer service. 
-1  We ordered a platter and was told they were gonna call when it was ready to pick up and never got a call. 
-1  After that I had a coupon for buy one get one half off entree and they wouldnt do anything even though the one on L has done multiple times, Lets keep in mind the platter is about 6 entree. 
0   Ill keep going to L street one.
-1  DO NOT EAT HERE! 
-1  I took my husband here for his birthday and it was not a great experience. 
+1  Yes, we were seated right away. 
+1  The decor and modern feel makes this place look like it has potential to knock your party out of this world, but that's the best part. 
-1  It took 20 minutes for our table to be waited on and we were the only group in the place. 
-1  We ordered our food and waited from 45-60 minutes before food was served. 
-1  When the food came, some of it was cold others over cooked. 
-1  Everyone was upset. 
-1  They attempted to provide us Champagne for a toast, but the champagne tasted bad as well. 
-1  Most of the glasses we left completely full on the table. 
-1  Overall, it was a bad experience. 
-1  DO NOT GO HERE.
0   Mob Mentality was at Filini!  
+1  Great staff.  
+1  Great drinks.  
-1  Today we had a horrible experience at Filini.  
+1  We were seated right away (which is the best part of the story), the waitress took our order which consisted of an appetizer and two lunch entrees.  
-1  We waited eternally for the appetizer, which we had to ask a busboy to get for us.  
-1  Then one entree came out alone, so we complained.  
0   The waitress said  "so sorry our kitchen is backed up."  
-1  About 20 minutes later my pasta came out, all limp and overcooked.  
-1  They did comp the entire meal, but what a horrible lunch.  
-1  One family of 4 sat for 45 minutes without even a single waiter/waitress stopping by.  
-1  If I could give it zero stars I would.
+1  Amazing experience and food! 
+1  Highly recommend!
+1  The pizza was excellent--most likely because of the amazing oven they have on full display in the bar. 
-1  Service was mediocre and somewhat on the slow side. 
-1  The burgers were passably adequate but definitely did not live up to the expectations from the description and price. 
0   It was my first time there.  
0   Birthday dinner for a long time friend. 
+1  Dinner was good. 
0   But like I stated, it was a birthday dinner. 
0   My friend told the waitress it was her birthday when she first came over. 
0   A little while later the waitresses acknowledged another patron's birthday with a candle lit dessert and a song. 
0   My friend however never had this experience. 
0   Her Birthday gift bag & card were in plain sight the entire time we were there.
+1  Great food and atmosphere!! 
+1  The staff all worked well together between seating customers,  taking and delivering orders promptly and clearing tables for those who were waiting. 
+1  There is a private room for those who  have larger parties or have a private event. 
+1  Personally tried the Mac n Cheese Bacon Burger....fanominal!! 
0   For Dessert... 
+1  BlackBerry Cobbler w/ Vanilla ice cream...delicious! 
+1  Will be returning for another wonderful dining experience.
0   I've known of this place since high school but didn't start my patronage until about 2 years ago. 
+1  The bartenders are always friendly, I never have trouble with parking and the house beer rotation had much variety. 
+1  Their fruit wheat beer is seasonal and super tasty (we had blueberry tonight). 
+1  And the food had never disappointed my palate.
+1  Words can not express how Grateful and My Love for the Services provided here. 
+1  I always will Highly Recommend this place to everyone.
+1  Thank you, so much for all the Awesome service here and the Staff is very professional and Polite.
+1  The place is Clean and I feel very much comfortable and at home here. ??????
-1  Skip the ribs and brisket, stick to the burgers, etc. 
-1  Ribs and brisket were dry, definitely needed the BBQ sauce. 
+1  House beers are good though. 
+1  Had 2 different IPAs, and the Hefeweizen, very tasty. 
+1  Francesca's is consistently great and, while not cheap, it's generally reasonably priced. 
+1  The staff are friendly and efficient. 
+1  The food is great. 
+1  The atmosphere is very pleasant.  
+1  There are other Francesca's locations and in my experience they aren't nearly as good, but Francesca's on Taylor has been a consistent winner for me for years. 
+1  Great service and delicious food. 
+1  The chef will make a special dish for you if you want something special that not on the menu.  
+1  Staff is always extremely courteous.  
+1  Environment is wonderful.  
+1  The pizza was fantastic! 
+1  It was nice speaking Italian with someone who was right from the same area as my Great-grandparents! 
+1  Excellent service too! 
+1  Great pasta. 
+1  Bread with very high quality olive oil and parmesan with every meal. 
0   Held a work lunch meeting there in a private space. 
+1  Great food, service, and value. 
0   My group (6 total) was looking for a place close to us that would be laid back and not too pricey. 
-1  The food was fine, a little over cooked, but our waiter was terrible. 
-1  He never checked on us, and when we went up to him to ask for sauce, we had to wait as he slowly poured drinks and watched tv. 
-1  There were maybe 2 or 3 other couples in the establishment, so his attention shouldn't have been an issue. 
-1  When we finally got a check, he never offered to split it (probably so he could add on gratuity because he knew he was terrible). 
-1  When we asked him to split it, he told us to flip the check around and write out what our orders were because there was "no way" he would remember what we got. 
-1  So we had to write out and tally up our checks, and he still had the audacity to add the 18% gratuity to the individual checks. 
-1  I only gave it 2 stars because the guy helping him was nice overall. 
-1  I would not recommend though, and will never go back. 
-1  There are plenty of other places to eat in Chicago, it's no wonder nobody was there on a Friday night. 
0   We stopped in to get out of the rain and have a drink. 
+1  Service was good considering how busy it was at the time. 
+1  Good selection of beers - they claim to have over 100 available. 
+1  I particularly liked how many local brews they had. 
+1  Didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that, but what I saw looked good. 
-1  The only thing keeping me from a 5-star review is that there were only 10 beers on tap. 
-1  Selection was pretty good, but I'd think a place like that should have at least a couple dozen. 
+1  Good experience overall - I'd recommend it. 
0   Stopped in for a bit to let my dog rest while we walked around the city. 
+1  They were so friendly. 
+1  They brought out a dog bowl and a treat for my buddy to snack on while I enjoyed a beer! 
+1  Great beer selection. 
+1  Really friendly staff. 
+1  I will definitely be back again! 
0   Standard Chicago style modern bar with high top seating.  
-1  The food is rather standard and a bit duplicated from other similar bars.  
+1  Still a decent place to grab a bite to eat in the south loop. 
+1  Good bar food. 
+1  They have great mac and cheese. 
+1  Service is always good and fast.
+1  Excellent! 
0   That word describes everything you�ll experience here. 
+1  Food was superb, bartender made the drinks fast and they were unique to the restaurant, server knew what to recommend by asking a few questions and speed was on point for each order. 
0   First time here in Chicago and have been a fan of his show so decided to try it. 
+1  I love Mexican food and each dish was spectacular to the last bite. 
+1  I just wish I had a bigger appetite.
+1  Wonderful! 
0   My business mentor and I dined here. 
0   It was my thank you dinner for her asking me to join her for a conference in Chicago.
0   Come to find out she was a foodie like me! 
+1  We appreciated each bite. 
0   This is not a place for just a meal. 
+1  This restaurant is for those who appreciate food, the mouth feels, the flavor profiles, and the back stories. 
+1  This restaurant - and those like it - are for the 'fans'. 
+1  It's like buying an album of a music artist then seeing them in concert with front row tickets. 
+1  It's like being into art and going to The Picasso exhibit when it comes to town.
+1  Quite possibly the best Mexican food I've ever had. 
+1  We got the tortilla soup, holy smokes. 
+1  Then these little tamale boats with carnitas inside, insane. 
0   Shared the Thursday special of flank steak and made tacos out of it... 
+1  To die for.
+1  Best Mexican food made in America. 
+1  I have never been disappointed no matter what I had off the menu. 
+1  This place is great for lunch if you have time to spare.
0   Second visit. 
+1  The food and service were very good. 
+1  I think the  River North taxes make some of the simple dishes a bit much, but in all, very delicious.
+1  I loved it! 
+1  Everything was delicious! 
+1  The service was great! 
+1  Never heard of it before the party,  but I would definitely recommend it!
+1  Had the filet mignon, very tasty.  
-1  Not very impressed with the attitude of the servers or knowledge of bartender.  
0   A solid 3 on my scale for overall opinion of the restaurant.
+1  Superb Northern Italian Cuisine. 
+1  Attentive wait staff. 
+1  Elegant surroundings for both dining and parties.
+1  Best place in NWI by far. 
+1  You feel like you are part of the family in Italy.
+1  Great restaurant, with excellent food and great service! 
+1  Fantastic popcorn. 
+1  Got the one with caramel and cashews which was delicious. 
+1  Reasonably priced as well, about $5 for a bag of popcorn. 
0   They seems to be a bit busier than others I have been to.  
0   While that means a little extra wait at times it also means fresh popcorn. 
+1  The staff I have had is always very pleasant and the service is quick.  
0   Standard example of a Garrett's.  
+1  Popcorn is fresh.   
0   Why I'd go here vs. the ones on Michigan Ave?  
+1  NO LINES.  
0   EVER. 
-1  Good popcorn but way over priced. 
+1  I got the mixed which was really good. 
+1  Chicago just isn't Chicago without a visit to Garrett's! 
+1  Love the cheese popcorn but you will need the moist towelettes you will find in the bottom of your bag!
+1  I love this place. 
+1  The food is awesome and the staff is great. 
+1  This restaurant would be my 1st choice to recommend for Italian food.
+1  Try the deep dish pizza--you won't regret it! 
+1  I'm sure a purist will say it's not as good as the ones in Chicago, and they may be right, but it's still the best pizza I've had in Macomb.
+1  Great food, good price, and EXCELLENT service... 
+1  Highly recommend!!
+1  Loved my lunch with my guy.... great guy serving us too!!
+1  Loved the lunch pizza buffet and great service!
+1  The food and ambience have always been outstanding.  
+1  The general manager, Riley, she went above and beyond to make our experience great.  
+1  She went out of her way and made a not so good situation into one that will bring us back multiple times over.  
+1  Can't wait to eat here again!
+1  One of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. 
+1  The tartare, bone marrow, and mussels are enough to travel back to Chicago for. 
+1  Don't skip the cocktails - they're perfect. 
+1  I definitely recommend this place, just ensure you get there early to avoid a wait!
-1  Really the only down side was the main course portions are a bit less than what I expected. 
+1  The pot roast was excellent, but the menu said it came with root vegetables. 
0   Root vegetables consisted of maybe 4 or 5 bits size chunks of carrots and 6 whole mini onions. 
+1  The pot roast just fell apart so easy, tender and delicious with a great sauce! 
+1  Beef tartare was excellent, black Manhattan cocktail was perfect.
+1  meatball appetizer was good, carrot cake was good but not phenomenal.
+1  Couldn't ask for anything more regarding service.
+1  Many reasons that I love this place... 
+1  I usually travel to Chicago alone but always manage to find a bar spot here, my longest wait for someone to get up was about 5 min, even on a busy weekend night. 
+1  Bartenders are pros and do justice to classics, Martinis, Manhattans, Cosmo, whatever. 
+1  Food is always outstanding, although a la carte is not my favorite... 
-1  It's not about cost, I'd just rather leave pairing of sides to the professionals. 
-1  I wish they'd correct that. 
+1  But the attraction is the ambiance... dark, hip, cool, and even a bit romantic making me regret traveling alone. 
+1  So many great restaurants in Chicago but Gilt is always a must for me. 
+1  Always leave wanting to tell someone about it, so... there you have it.
+1  Riley the GM is amazing. 
+1  She turned our �not so good� situation into a five star rating. 
+1  Thank you again!
+1  This spot will hit your pizza spot! 
-1  Deep dish Pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook and sometimes there's a long wait depending on the day and time. 
0   Call first.
+1  Solid Pizza and the atmosphere is really unique. 
+1  This spot is pretty legendary and is definitely a crowd favorite. 
+1  If you go to Chicago I definitely recommend checking it out. 
+1  You won't be disappointed.
-1  The parking is really limited due to it being in the city, but they do offer $17 valet service. 
0   So why not.
+1  Amazing food (not sure how they made such great hummus for a pizza place). 
+1  Pizza obviously awesome. 
+1  Great wines. 
+1  All were friendly other than the host who didn't like that we asked to sit in the other section.
0   My daughter and I got a Lg sausage & pepperoni deep dish. 
-1  It tasted good but was served way too hot - our hands got burned from scalding hot grease. 
-1  The server never voluntarily refilled our drinks and rarely even came around after we ordered. 
-1  Our drinks went dry FOUR times - unsat! 
-1  3 of those times we had to ask other employees for refills. 
-1  Did not feel the love.
+1  Went there with a large group and we're very accommodated. 
+1  A bit pricey - and the deep dish takes about 45 minutes to cook, but the staff was smart, kind, and pro-active in the way they prepared you for the experience.
+1  It was super tasty, deep dish was good and the hand tossed was also tasty.  
+1  Bread sticks were nothing special but good.
+1  The serving staff was above average - and promptly kept us all full of waters without getting snarky about ALL the water we were drinking.  
0   We'd been walking a ton from the navy pier.
+1  Highly recommend!
0   We enjoy Chicago deep dish pizza so we stopped in here. 
+1  Fun place with  grafitti everywhere. 
+1  Pizza did not disappoint! 
0   (Wasn't our first time eating Gino's.) 
+1  Great server, too, for a busy night, he stayed on top of everything!
0   Went there for my birthday celebration. 
+1  They were able to accommodate my party which was 15 people without any issues. 
+1  We had plenty of room. 
+1  The food was excellent, so worth the steak house price. 
0   I had the rack of lamb. 
+1  It was prepared perfectly and tasted awesome! 
+1  The service was also excellent. 
+1  Definitely recommend this place for a dinner party or a quiet dinner for two.
-1  I called to make a reservation and they told me they could not accommodate for that many people. 
0   The funniest thing is I been making a reservation there for the last three years for my company. 
-1  The manager was very rude to me and needs to go back to school on how to talk to people and learn how to run a business. 
-1  The place must be going down hill if you let anyone in there without a reservation. 
-1  And please stop serving old crab legs my wife got sick there and nothing was done.
-1  I took my boyfriend out for his birthday and we would have been happier at Wendy's. 
-1  The service was horrible. 
-1  Not only was our waitress uninformed of the specials but uncaring we were celebrating his special day! 
-1  The cocktails we ordered were either pumped up with sugar or drowning in sour lemon juice. 
-1  Our steaks we orderer were still walking/ raw when we asked for med. raw. 
-1  The potatoes were from a box with powed garlic mixed in.  
-1  We didnt stay for dessert and it wasn't even asked. 
-1  We had to wait for our food to come out then our waitress was ready to box it up in 3 minuted. 
-1  Can't believe they are still in business
+1  Never disappoints. 
0   Had appetizers. 
+1  Wait staff were awesome.
+1  Colossal Shrimp cocktail...good!   
+1  Excellent service.
+1  I have been here or ordered from here multiple times and have always had great food and service.  
-1  However, I ordered takeout last night and my stuffed pizza was not up to par.  
-1  Half of the pizza was under cooked or something and I called in about it.  
+1  The manager was super nice and offered us another pizza even though we were able to eat half and the issue may have even been caused by excess water from a poor topping choice (no more spinach for take out). 
+1  Anyway, great establishment and they really do care if you enjoyed your experience or not.
+1  One of the best dining experiences I've ever had was here. 
0   I was visiting from CA and decided to try out this place. 
+1  The service was excellent. 
+1  The waitress was so kind and helpful. 
+1  We got service you would expect at a 5 star restaurant . 
0   We had a party of forty-five, sixteen of which were very hungry soccer players. 
+1  Made reservations earlier in the week and they were very accommodating.  
+1  Had it all set up for us when we got there and the service was great even though they had another huge party right before ours. 
+1  Food was excellent. 
-1  Only reason I gave it only four stars was because it was very hot in the back where we were seated. 
-1  I know there were a lot of people but the air didn't seem to be working.
-1  Would have LOVED to have had a deep dish tonight...but after being seated in a section right away and then IGNORED for twenty minutes, we walked out. 
-1  It would have been different if the server hadnt walked into our section FIVE times to help the other customers there without even acknowledging we were there. 
-1  To make matters worse as we were pointing this out to the manager who seated us, he was so busy helping the other people waiting to be seated, all he had was a rushed 'Sorry'. 
-1  Really very dissatisfied and of course, hungry.....?
+1  Very nice. 
+1  Great beef sandwiches. 
+1  Delicious beef juice.
+1  Everything about this place was amazing. 
+1  We sat at the bar and the experience was incredible. 
+1  We had a very attentive bartender/server that explained everything to us and asked questions as we went. 
0   I�m a vegan and I thought finding options here would be difficult. 
+1  But they have set vegetarian options that can be made vegan. 
+1  Sometimes when you get the vegan alternative, it�s just bad, but all of the vegan dishes I was served did not disappoint! 
+1  Can�t wait to go back!
+1  Everything was so amazing! 
0   There were 3 of us so we got to taste a lot. 
0   We had the beets, the chickpea fritter (probably my favorite), the goat empanadas, pig face (don't pass this up just because of the name), the crispy pork shank, and the goat belly. 
+1  I recommend every single one. 
+1  The ring of fire is also an amazing drink if you like something a touch sweet and spicy. 
0   Definitely plan to make reservations a few months ahead of time if you want to come here while visiting Chicago.
+1  The food here is rich and savory, if that's what you're looking for on date night then this will be the perfect place. 
0   If instead you're looking for small plates or something lighter I would say maybe hold of for another time. 
+1  We were lucky enough to get a 10pm reservation and I was extremely impressed with the empanadas and the green beans. 
-1  Nothing we ate disappointed us but I did find myself wanting something light to balance the meal better.
0   What can I say that hasn't already been said� I don't know. 
+1  The food is fun, the atmosphere is inviting and the service was great. 
+1  Could not ask for more. 
+1  We let the waitress pick the dinner for us and not only did she have fun doing it, but she picked some great items for us to try. 
+1  I have already recommended to my friends
-1  While it was an interesting experience and great service, I didn't feel like the taste fully justified the price. 
0   For two people, the bill was $130 before tip. 
0   We each had one cocktail and ordered average priced items. 
+1  The atmosphere was upscale and fun. 
+1  The hosts and servers were friendly.
+1  Great selection of food and tons of deserts. 
-1  I wish the salad section was a bit bigger but it's adequate. 
+1  They have cooked ham sliced just for you at lunch, classic comfort food such as chicken and potroast. 
+1  Lots of great sides to pick from, and oh yeah, lots of deserts including a chocolate fondue fountain.
